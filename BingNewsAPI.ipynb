Please enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy noticeA mother-of-two was investigated for “modern slavery” after a Ukrainian refugee she was hosting in the UK complained to the police. Hannah Debenham and her husband invited the woman and her 10 year-old daughter to stay at their home in Sussex under the Homes for Ukraine scheme in June. Ms Debenham says they had made an arrangement that the woman would provide babysitting services a few days a week, for £200. But the NHS mental health specialist said that after a “honeymoon period” the arrangement soon broke down, with the host claiming the family did not clean up after themselves.On 20 July, Sussex Police received a report “of a person being required to perform forced or compulsory labour”.Has your hosting arrangement broken down? If so email holly.bancroft@independent.co.ukRecommendedUkraine: Blackouts back in Kyiv as war takes multiple frontsZelensky accuses Russian commanders of ‘crazy’ tactics to escalate war in UkraineGermany needs to stop apologising and defend its record with RussiaMs Debenham was interviewed by police during a weeks-long investigation that eventually found no evidence of any wrongdoing. The force said the complainant refused to provide a full statement or assist with further enquiries. The Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched by the government in March but concerns have been raised by charities about an increasing number of families presenting as homeless as hosting arrangements end or break down. Speaking out about the ordeal, Ms Debenham told Mail Online the police investigation was “the worst experience of her life”.”It was just devastating,” she said. “We just wanted to help. If I was charged I would have had to declare that and it would have been a permanent impediment to my career.“They also spoke to my husband and told him that I could face life in prison if I was found guilty.“I’ve been an NHS mental health specialist for 15 years and I have often worked with people with severe mental illness supporting their needs in police custody, and this happening to me was the worst experience of my life.”Ms Debenham said she understood the woman was in a “terrible situation” having fled her country due to Russia’s war but the hosting arrangement did not improve. She eventually asked the woman to leave, and days later the police arrived at her home. Police have defended the investigation, stressing that allegations of this nature are taken “very seriously” and needed to be “properly investigated”.A spokesperson for Sussex Police said they had “received a report on July 20 of a person being required to perform forced or compulsory labour”.“On July 26, a woman from Uckfield, who had offered to host the pair, was invited to attend a voluntary interview at Eastbourne police station with her solicitor on August 16. She was not arrested.“Following that interview, the informant was approached on several occasions to provide a full statement, but was not willing to assist with further enquiries or to provide a formal account.“As a result, it was judged that there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution and no further action would be taken. The woman’s solicitor was advised the same day of the decision.”RecommendedZelensky accuses Russian commanders of ‘crazy’ tactics to escalate war in UkrainePutin accuses West of fuelling war he started in quest for ‘global domination’Detective Chief Inspector Gavin Patch added: “This investigation was expedited as quickly as possible, but given the nature of the allegations that were made, it was important that both sides were given the opportunity to provide their accounts of what had occurred and other agencies involved consulted.“In this case, there was insufficient evidence to proceed, but we take any allegations of this nature very seriously and it is important that they are properly investigated.”.

      "Almost half of all modern slavery referrals in Lancashire are children. Lancashire TelegraphAlmost half of all modern slavery referrals in Lancashire are childrenRead full articleAmy Farnworth20 October 2022, 5:00 am·4-min readModern slavery (Image: PA Archive/PA Images)The number of cases of modern slavery referred to police in Lancashire has risen over the last year, with almost half of them being children.Latest Home Office figures show 145 potential modern slavery cases were referred to the police for investigation in the year to June – and of them, 61 were aged 17 and under.The total number is up from 129 the year before.Across the rest of the UK, modern slavery referrals for suspected victims have also risen.There were 14,600 in the year to June, and 5,800 of them were children – up from 11,600 and 5,200 respectively the year before.The rise in cases comes as the Home Office revealed plans to restrict such claims to stop alleged \"abuse\" of the system.Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman received criticism for attributing the increase in modern slavery victims to migrants who were \"gaming the system\" by claiming asylum in the UK as victims of slavery, and reclassifying the crime as an \"illegal immigration and asylum\" issue, rather than a safeguarding one.Potential cases are flagged through the National Referral Mechanism, which allows first responders, including local authorities, charities and certain government departments, to refer them to police forces for investigation.Revealing plans to crack down on what she sees as fraudulent claims for asylum under the Modern Slavery Act, Ms Braverman said recently: \"The truth is that many of them are not modern slaves and their claims of being trafficked are lies.\"Since the new Home Office was formed, modern slavery has been listed as an \"illegal immigration and asylum\" issue overseen by the immigration minister, rather than under the duties of the safeguarding minister as before.This has resulted in anti-slavery charities calling on the Government to stop \"distracting attention from the real criminals\".The action came ahead of Anti-Slavery Day on October 18, which is hosted by a range of anti-slavery charities and organisations, including Hope For Justice, and raises awareness of the 50million people in slavery around the world.Story continuesHope for Justice said Ms Braverman's reclassification of modern slavery is \"highly regressive\" and the shifting of responsibility will exacerbate the issue.Meanwhile, anti-slavery charity Unseen said the numbers show there is still a long way to go to eradicate slavery in the UK and called on the Government to \"stop conflating modern slavery and immigration\".Chief executive of Unseen, Andrew Wallis, said: \"The Government has provided no evidence that asylum seekers are gaming the system, and by putting out such spurious claims without facts or context is verging on irresponsible.\"The result is we’re treating vulnerable people as criminals when they most need our help, and distracting attention from the real criminals behind slavery and trafficking.\"The Home Office said it is \"committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery\" and that the National Referral Mechanism will continue to function in the same way.But a spokesperson for the Home Office added: \"It is clear people are abusing our system when they have no right to be here in order to frustrate their removal.\"Det Sgt Stu Peall of Lancashire Constabulary's human trafficking and modern slavery team said: “Modern slavery is a real issue, with those involved being exploited and controlled against their will for personal or commercial gain.“The perpetrators who commit this type of crime prey on vulnerable people, taking away their freedom and leaving them with no control over their own lives, or treated as nothing more than a commodity.“Lancashire Constabulary is committed to investigating offences of modern slavery and we regularly carry out days or weeks of action, with surge activity focusing on arresting those responsible and safeguarding victims. This is also part and parcel of our daily business and is an issue we take very seriously.“We welcome any community intelligence that can help to identify where modern slavery is taking place. If you have any information about suspicious activity, please let us know. We take all reports seriously and will investigate thoroughly.“We also want to offer help and support for people who think they may be victims of this type of crime.”You can either contact the police on 101, call 999 in an emergency or report information online at Lancashire Police's website.If you do not wish to speak to police directly there are charities that can help you, anonymously if you wish..

      "Suella Braverman and British victims of modern slavery - Ekklesia. Suella Braverman and British victims of modern slavery. SUELLA BRAVERMAN’S UGLY BRAND OF ‘PATRIOTISM’, which seems to consist largely of being as harsh as possible towards asylum seekers, may paradoxically result in a failure to protect or support some of the most vulnerable British citizens – including children. Indeed, her approach could be a grim example of how xenophobic right-wing politics always fails the least privileged, no matter what their nationality.. In August, a joint report from the British Red Cross and the UN Refugee Agency found that people seeking asylum in the UK were placed at risk of modern slavery because there was “too much focus on immigration enforcement rather than safety and protection”.. Nevertheless, in her first incarnation as Home Secretary, Suella Braverman announced that the focus on immigration enforcement would become even more intense. In a speech to the Conservative Party Conference she said: “our modern slavery laws are being abused by people gaming the system. We’ve seen a 450 per cent increase in modern slavery claims since 2014.”  The implication was that large numbers of people were falsely claiming to be victims of modern slavery, in order to be allowed to stay in the UK. This claim was comprehensively demolished by several organisations, including the Christian Action, Education, and Research Centre (CARE).. To be recognised as a possible victim of modern slavery, people must be referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM). Individuals cannot refer themselves, it has to be done by a ‘first responder’ organisation, such as a local authority, police force, specified NGO or government agency. So the increase in referrals is not coming from individuals with an ulterior motive, it is coming from official sources.  And far from overstating the issue, those figures are almost certainly a significant underestimate. In 2021 there were almost 13,000 referrals to the NRM, but Iain Duncan Smith’s Centre for Social Justice believes: “there could be at least 100,000 victims in the UK, with the actual number likely to be even greater.”. Braverman’s ‘spinning’ of the facts around such a serious crime, against all available evidence, is bad enough. But using it to further her own ant-immigration agenda risks ignoring the large numbers of UK citizens who may become victims. Indeed, in the most recent figures for people referred to the NRM, the second most common nationality was British.. As the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre says: “Last year, British nationals accounted for nearly a third of all potential victims (31 per cent). The largest proportion of these referrals in 2021 was for criminal exploitation involving children, representing 55 per cent of all referrals of British nationals, with the majority exploited in criminal activities such as ‘county lines’.”. We know that the trafficking of children within the UK for criminal exploitation is increasing. Children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities are particularly vulnerable, as are those living in poverty. Despite this, Ms Braverman has removed responsibility for modern slavery from the portfolio of the Safeguarding Minister, and given it to the Immigration Minister– currently Robert Jenrick.. The anti-slavery charity Hope for Justice said of Ms Braverman’s decision, “Broadly speaking, we think the move is highly regressive; there is a worrying conflation between illegal immigration and modern slavery and the shifting of responsibility from the safeguarding minister to immigration minister is likely to exacerbate the issue.”. This conflation has contributed to a culture in civil society which often fails to see British people as potential victims in need of protection. As the Modern Slavery Centre says: “What sets British citizens affected by modern slavery apart from other potential victims is that they have regularly come into contact with social services, schools and education institutions, mental and physical health professionals even before their exploitation starts. Despite this, agencies that are designed to support them, regularly miss opportunities to protect them from being exploited.”. The Centre’s report, Protecting British nationals from modern slavery recommends a public health approach, and “reframing the national policy approach away from a primary focus on ‘border protection’ towards prevention, recovery and protection needs of victims”. But when the report was published in September, the Home Secretary was doing the exact opposite.. There is evidence that the wider government, whilst not averse to allowing modern slavery to be used as a divisive propaganda tool, is less than serious about actually tackling it. The post of Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner (IASC) has remained vacant for more than six months, long before the appointment of Ms Braverman as Home Secretary. On the Commissioner’s website the most recent post, on 1 May, said: “In the absence of a commissioner, IASC staff attending meetings or engaging with stakeholders will have no remit to provide views or take on or contribute to new work.”. The Conservatives’ erosion of our social fabric, via the slashing of public services and social security, has increased the numbers of British people who are vulnerable to becoming victims of modern slavery. Having increased this vulnerability, the Conservatives seem to be disregarding the human consequences but using the issue to foment the division and xenophobia which they hope may keep them in power.

Privacy NoticeClose to 8,000 people are said to have been victims of modern slavery in the UK in the first six months of 2022, according to a leading independent body. Such slavery includes a range of exploitative practices, from forced, compulsory, and child labour, to debt bondage and human trafficking. Criminal practice affects more than 40 million people worldwide – 24.9 million of which are said to be exploited through forced labour, with 16 million in global supply chains. And numbers indicate that 2022 could become the worst year so far for modern slavery in the UK – with crooks who profit from this making approximately £128 billion annually as a result. In response, on Anti-Slavery Day, BSI (The British Standards Institution) have announced the launch of its world’s first national standard to help organisations across the UK and abroad to eradicate modern slavery. With companies facing increased scrutiny over supply chain issues regarding social responsibility, organisational impact, and Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) reporting, the modern slavery standard provides guidance for businesses to identify risks, and potential victims, while offering advice on how to combat the issue.. The most common forms of slavery to look out for include forced or compulsory labour, and human trafficking. Susan Taylor Martin, CEO of BSI, said: “Global disruptions such as COVID-19 and the return of war in Europe have changed the game and created greater risks of modern slavery than were faced in 2015, when the Modern Slavery Act was enacted. “Far more can and must be done to bridge the gap between policy and practice. “BSI is committed to helping organisations understand what they can do in practical terms to eliminate this corrupt, criminal behaviour which continues to plague the global economy.”. Rights and duties concerning modern slavery already exist in UK legislation, notably through the Modern Slavery Act 2015, as well as through international UN and ILO frameworks.

And quarter-on-quarter referral numbers continued to increase into 2022, with 3,777 in Q1 2022, and 4,171 in Q2 2022. Such trends indicate 2022 could become the worst year so far for modern slavery referrals in the UK. While existing legislation provides duties for organisations with an annual turnover of £36 million or more to report on modern slavery, the new standard is applicable to organisations of any size or type – which is critical given that SMEs make up 99 per cent of businesses, and three-fifths of employment in the UK.

      "Home Office sees modern slavery in the UK as an immigration issue. ConstructionModern slaveryEconomics, government & businessLatest NewsHospitality. Home Office shifts modern slavery to immigration brief. The Home Office has removed the modern slavery brief from the minister responsible for safeguarding and classed it as an ‘illegal immigration and asylum’ issue.. There are suggestions that the move, signposted on the profile pages of the ministers involved in the issue, was the result of the then-home secretary Suella Braverman’s stated belief that modern slavery was the outcome of people “gaming” the immigration system. The Guardian first drew attention to the changes in responsibility. Braverman resigned as home secretary yesterday.. Modern slavery is now listed at the bottom of the “illegal immigration and asylum” brief of immigration minister Tom Pursglove and no longer mentioned on the page of the safeguarding minister Mims Davies.. Under Theresa May in 2016, the government pledged to be world leaders in combating modern slavery but Braverman said last week that trafficking claims from “people gaming the system” were “derailing the UK’s policy on illegal migration”.. But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper last week said the largest single group of modern slavery victims under the referral system last year were British children.. Cooper added: “The evidence shows the majority of exploitation takes place in the UK rather than across borders.. “The government should be treating this as an enforcement and safeguarding issue and taking stronger action against the crime of modern slavery wherever it takes place.”. We don’t see people gaming the system … What we see is vulnerable people who are being exploited by opportunists and criminals” – Elysia McCaffrey, Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. Lucy Symington, parliamentary officer for campaign group Anti-Slavery, said: “The government has a duty to protect all survivors of modern slavery. It’s a question of ensuring the rights and freedoms of people without them, and they live right here in our communities. We challenge all rhetoric that suggests otherwise and stand up to scapegoating of modern slavery victims to advance a political agenda at the expense of people’s welfare.”. Olivia Field, head of policy at the British Red Cross, told the Guardian: “Modern slavery is a crime that can impact people no matter where they are from or where they are in the world.. “So it doesn’t become any harder for people to get the help they need, we would urge the lens on tackling modern slavery to be a safeguarding one focused on protecting people impacted by this crime, as opposed to being treated as an immigration issue.”. Writing a modern slavery statement: a guide for employers. The former home secretary’s comments were also challenged by the chief executive of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, Elysia McCaffrey, who said: “We don’t see people gaming the system … What we see is vulnerable people who are being exploited by opportunists and criminals.”. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and in the UK we have a world-leading response. However, it is clear people are abusing our system when they have no right to be here, in order to frustrate their removal.”. The Home Office said that given the close links between modern slavery and migration having one minister oversee both modern slavery and migration will help to ensure the interaction works effectively. It explained that handing the immigration minister oversight of the policy would not affect the entitlements of victims.. It emphasised that decisions will continue to be taken on specific cases by the Single Competent Authority and the recently established Immigration Enforcement Competent Authority under the National Referral Mechanism.. According to Anti-Slavery, modern slavery in the UK can take many forms, including forced sexual exploitation, domestic slavery or forced labour on farms, in construction, shops, bars, nail bars, car washes and manufacturing.. We stand up to scapegoating of modern slavery victims to advance a political agenda at the expense of people’s welfare” – Lucy Symington, Anti-Slavery. Forced labour is the most common form of slavery in the UK, fuelled by a drive for cheap products and services. Working conditions in the garment industry of the east Midlands have come under particular scrutiny in this regard in recent years.. The group says one growing form of slavery is trafficking into crime. In the UK, it’s fuelled by the trafficking of primarily British children, forced into ‘county lines’ drug trafficking and trafficking of Vietnamese nationals forced to work in cannabis production.. The government, say campaigners, will have to show that the British victims of slavery will not now fall through the gaps, now that problem is primarily seen as an immigration issue.. In April this year it was reported that businesses were not fully complying with the 2015 Modern Slavery Act by omitting modern slavery statements from their websites or supplying cursory commentary on the issue. Much of the focus of larger UK firms is on the risk of modern slavery entering their supply chains in other countries, leaving them in breach of the 2015 Act.. There are up to 100,000 victims of modern slavery and forced labour in the UK, according to Anti-Slavery.. The UK’s national standards body BSI on 18 October launched the UK’s first standard to help organisations to eradicate modern slavery in their supply chains.. The new standard: BS 25700 Organizational Responses to Modern Slavery, for use by international and UK organisations of all sizes, provides guidance on preventative measures, identifying, analysing, and evaluating exposure risks, approaches to address identified risks, remedying modern slavery practices, and reporting mechanisms. BSI said the new guidance would help organisations eradicate modern slavery in all forms.. Susan Taylor Martin, chief executive of BSI, said: “Global disruptions such as the pandemic and the return of war in Europe have created greater risks of modern slavery than those faced in 2015 when the Modern Slavery Act was enacted.. “Far more can be done to bridge the gap between policy and practice. BSI is committed to helping organisations understand what they can do in practical terms to eradicate this corrupt, criminal behaviour which continues to plague the global economy.”.

      "Home secretary accused of ‘scapegoating’ modern slavery victims as new laws planned. Home secretary accused of ‘scapegoating’ modern slavery victims as new laws planned. The government has been accused of “scapegoating” modern slavery victims as it draws up new laws to restrict claims by asylum seekers. The Independent understands that Suella Braverman wants to stop what she sees as the abuse of current powers by migrants crossing the English Channel, after accusing them of “gaming the system”.New legislation which could change the operation of Theresa May's Modern Slavery Act is being discussed by the Home Office, Downing Street and government lawyers.The plans go further than a package of immigration laws brought in by Priti Patel that criminalised Channel crossings, aiming to make sure that the Rwanda deal and other moves to reject asylum seekers can be implemented.In an exclusive article for The Independent, the head of Anti-Slavery International accused the new home secretary of spreading “dangerous narratives that scapegoat victims and question their integrity”.Jasmine O’Connor OBE added: “The government needs to honestly listen to survivors, and safeguard them against future abuse, not use them as a pawn in a game of hostile rhetoric and a divide and rule strategy.“This bill must extend – rather than roll back – support and protections for all victims.”In her Conservative Party conference speech, Ms Braverman said that some Albanian migrants crossing the English Channel were claiming protection but “their claims of being trafficked are lies”.She added: “The hard truth is that our modern slavery laws are being abused by people gaming the system. We’ve seen a 450 per cent increase in modern slavery claims since 2014.”Ms Braverman said convicted paedophiles and rapists had also tried to “game the system” by using claims of modern slavery to block deportations, including a man who went on to commit a further rape.Until recently, most modern slavery victims recognised by the UK's official system were British children exploited by criminal gangs but the new government has handed modern slavery to the minister responsible for illegal immigration and asylum. The move is believed to be sparked by a rising number of cases involving Albanian adults using the National Referral Mechanism, the system used by the government to identify modern slavery victims. Albanians overtook British children as the largest single group earlier this year and have also become a dominant nationality in small boat crossings.Between April and June, 91 per cent of adults and 92 per cent of children assessed by the National Referral Mechanism received “conclusive grounds decisions”, meaning they are granted specialist support as victims of slavery, trafficking, criminal exploitation or forced labour.The UN special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, Tomoya Obokata, said: “Designating modern slavery as an illegal migration issue is misleading as British nationals are also victimised. “This also stigmatises foreign victims who have suffered gross violations of human rights. Protection of all victims must be a priority.”The watchdog charged with overseeing modern slavery laws in the UK has not had a commissioner in place since April, and the former incumbent said she did not recognise Ms Braverman’s abuse claims.Dame Sara Thornton, the former independent anti-slavery commissioner, said that the number of referrals had risen since 2014 because of work by the Home Office, police and authorities to spot victims.“This is a hidden crime and we have got a lot better at identifying victims,” she told The Independent. “There has been a lot of work done by police forces, local authorities, Border Force and Immigration Enforcement to know what the signs are.“I don’t know where the evidence for claiming the rise is because of abuse has come from.”The government’s public appointments website says the competition for a new independent anti-slavery commissioner has closed, but there has been no announcement since final interviews took place six months ago.A post on the watchdog’s website said it has “no remit to provide views or take on or contribute to new work” in the absence of a commissioner – meaning it cannot assess Ms Braverman’s plans.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and in the UK we have a world-leading response. However, it is clear people are abusing our system when they have no right to be here, in order to frustrate their removal.“We must be able to tackle abuses in the system and make sure foreign national offenders or those who arrive here illegally and have no right to stay in the UK are not able to misuse a system intended to protect genuine victims in order to avoid justice.” From news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

He said: “My father had contracted tuberculosis and the conditions he was living in were not helping his illness. I wanted to earn more money so I could send it home to help him.. “The fact that I could not send money home while I was working in South Wales contributed to my dad’s illness getting worse and so bad that he could not work.. “I haven’t forgotten what they did to me, and I am still too scared to return to Wales.”. Freibergs, 40, of Morley Close, Newport, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour and arranging or facilitating the travel of another person with a view to exploitation. He was cleared of acting as an unlicensed gangmaster..

Councils across the country were required to publish statements addressing the issue in a move costing Government £36million in 2021. Modern slavery is defined as the recruitment, movement, harbouring or receiving of children, women or men through the use of force. It occurs on a huge scale across the globe and encompasses slavery, human trafficking, criminal exploitation, forced labour and sexual and domestic servitude. A report to Trafford's executive committee said they had four cases in the borough of 'cuckooing' - where drug dealers take over the home of a vulnerable person to use it as a base for county-lines dealing. And there are currently between 15 and 20 children's cases that are under investigation by the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) - a framework for identifying potential victims of modern slavery.

RISHI SUNAK must reverse government attacks on victims of modern slavery and trafficking, campaigners have demanded.. As the new PM steps into office, campaigners are urging him to prioritise modern slavery victims and move away from “harmful” rhetoric.. It comes after Suella Braverman, who was re-appointed as Home Secretary on Tuesday afternoon just six days after being forced to resign over a security breach, claimed people were “gaming” the slavery initiative for immigration purposes.. Concerns over Ms Braverman’s approach intensified earlier this month after it was revealed that her office had reclassified modern slavery as an “illegal immigration issue” rather than an issue for the safeguarding minister.. Her predecessor Priti Patel also set out to weaken protections for victims of modern slavery and trafficking in the new Nationality and Borders Bill.. Anti-Slavery International is calling on Mr Sunak to prioritise the crime, warning that recent government chaos and delays to new legislation aimed at strengthening protection and support for victims have put thousands at “real risk” of being forgotten and failed.. The charity’s CEO Jasmine O’Connor said: “In fewer than three months, we have had three prime ministers and three home secretaries – including one who shook the foundations of the UK’s protections for modern slavery victims.. “In these three months, crucial legislation on modern slavery has slowed or ground to a halt.. “In the UK at the moment, a three-month period could see over 4,000 people referred to authorities as potential victims of modern slavery, with 1,600 exploited as children.. “There is a real risk that thousands of victims and survivors are being forgotten and failed.

Such slavery includes a range of exploitative practices including forced, compulsory and child labour to debt bondage and human trafficking.Criminal practice affects more than 40 million people worldwide, 24.9 million of which are said to be exploited through forced labour, with 16 million in global supply chains.And crooks profiting from this make approximately £128 billion annually as a result.As a result, on Anti-Slavery Day, BSI (The British Standards Institution) have announced the launch of its world’s first national standard to help organizations across the UK and abroad to eradicate modern slavery.AdvertisementHide AdWith companies facing increased scrutiny over supply chain issues regarding social responsibility, organizational impact and Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) reporting, the modern slavery standard provides guidance for businesses to identify risks, and potential victims, while offering advice on how to combat the issue.Over 4,000 victims in the second half of 2022Susan Taylor Martin, CEO, BSI, said: “Global disruptions such as COVID-19 and the return of war in Europe have changed the game and created greater risks of modern slavery than were faced in 2015 when the Modern Slavery Act was enacted.“Far more can and must be done to bridge the gap between policy and practice.AdvertisementHide Ad“BSI is committed to helping organizations understand what they can do in practical terms to eliminate this corrupt, criminal behaviour which continues to plague the global economy.”Rights and duties concerning modern slavery already exist in UK legislation, notably through the Modern Slavery Act 2015, as well as through international UN and ILO frameworks.However, in the UK the number of potential victims of modern slavery referred to the National Referral Mechanism rose from 2,340 in 2014 to more than 12,700 in 2021, with quarter-on-quarter referral numbers increasing into 2022 with 3,777 in Q1 2022 and 4,171 in Q2 2022.Such trends indicate 2022 could become the worst year so far for modern slavery referrals in the UK.AdvertisementHide AdWhile existing legislation provides duties for organizations with an annual turnover of £36 million or more to report on modern slavery, the new standard is applicable to organizations of any size or type – critical given SMEs make up 99 per cent of businesses and three-fifths of employment in the UK.'Much-needed' guidance for organisations combat modern slaveryA survivor of modern slavery, who can only be referred to as Mr. K for safety reasons, helped create the standard and said: “To contribute to such an important standard and knowing my experience will help so many people affected by modern slavery in the future, is both empowering and an integral part of my own personal recovery.“Also, being part of Survivor Alliance has been a lifeline for me and I hope this important piece of work produced is embraced by all so we can create a greater awareness of modern slavery and help put an end to it once and for all.”AdvertisementHide AdThe national standard provides guidance on managing the risk of modern slavery through prevention, identification, response, remediation, mitigation, and reporting, to encourage organizations to close this gap and meaningfully address the problem.Scott Steedman, Director-General Standards, BSI, added: “Too many organizations, large and small, do not understand the prevalence and locations of modern slavery in their supply chains and they also lack knowledge on how to protect themselves from its risks.“With this new National Standard BSI is providing much-needed guidance to help organizations act decisively to understand, identify risks, and combat modern slavery.”Europe. ©National World Publishing Ltd.

      "Garment nearshoring hotspot Turkey deemed high risk for modern slavery. Garment nearshoring hotspot Turkey deemed high risk for modern slavery. The risk of modern slavery continues to rise globally, including in garment producing countries, a new report has found and it suggests Turkey is now listed as a most at-risk country due to an increase in reported forced labour cases.. Climate change, poverty contributing to modern slavery. A study by Verisk Maplecroft found that almost a quarter of countries across the world have witnessed a significant deterioration in the company’s Modern Slavery Index since 2016 and Turkey, which has grown in popularity for garment manufacturing due to its proximity to Europe is now listed as high risk. In addition, the subnational version of the Index reveals that two-thirds of the global population now live in high or extreme risk states or provinces.. The report by Verisk Maplecroft helps to show why and where these risks are manifesting. It has found that climate change is now a factor, alongside rising poverty levels. And the report predicts the chances of goods produced using forced labour entering supply chains are only likely to worsen due to these issues, despite new and upcoming legislation in the US and EU to eradicate the practice.. “Regulators, investors, shareholders and consumers are all becoming acutely aware of the modern slavery risks that have been evident for years to NGOs, activists and exploited people,” says Verisk Maplecroft’s director of human rights Dr James Sinclair. “But with data from the ILO showing that 50 million people are trapped in modern slavery globally, the problem is getting worse, not better, meaning that organisations need to work harder to keep goods tainted by forced labour out of their supply chain.”. The European Commission’s newly unveiled plan to ban products made with forced labour from entering the EU market is the latest in a growing list of human rights due diligence laws. If it comes into force, the ban will join the United States’ Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) in attempting to eradicate forced labour from global supply chains.. According to the report, poverty has long been a key determining factor in the prevalence of modern slavery. Households lacking economic security are more likely to become dependent on employment agents within the informal economy, which can lead to exploitation. This is reflected in the data: 17 of the 24 extreme risk countries on the latest edition of the MSI are low and lower-middle income economies. This group includes Myanmar and Pakistan, two leading exporters of goods including clothing and cotton fabric.. But workers in developed economies aren’t immune to exploitation. The report found that the number of high and upper-middle income economies rated high or extreme risk on the MSI has risen to 44, up from 39 when the dataset launched in 2016.. Several higher income economies feature among those that have seen the largest increase in risk in that time, including Turkey, which has plummeted 46 places in the index to 62nd most at-risk country.. The country is now within the Index’s high risk category, triggered by an increase in reported cases of forced labour involving Syrian migrants, including children, within the garment industry and the agricultural sector.. Also featured in the report is China – the largest sourcing country. Ranked 18th, China is rated ‘extreme risk’ due to reports of human rights violations in Xinjiang. However, China’s commanding position within several industries means eradicating its abuses from global supply chains is easier said than done, the report suggests.. “The factors driving the negative global trend in modern slavery risk are set to worsen in the coming years,” the report reads. “Rising inflation and fears of a global recession suggest the world is headed for a period of prolonged economic instability which will leave millions more people vulnerable to exploitation. At the same time, even the most optimistic warming scenarios suggest that climate-driven migration will ramp up by mid-century.. “This, combined with the expansion of the regulatory landscape governing forced labour, presents a growing dilemma for companies that had traditionally relied on sourcing low-cost labour abroad.”.

      "Modern slavery cases rise in Lancs as Home Office accuse victims of 'abusing system' | Lancashire Telegraph. Almost half of all modern slavery referrals in Lancashire are children. Modern slavery cases rise in Lancs as Home Office accuse victims of 'abusing system'. Modern slavery (Image: PA Archive/PA Images). The number of cases of modern slavery referred to police in Lancashire has risen over the last year, with almost half of them being children.. Latest Home Office figures show 145 potential modern slavery cases were referred to the police for investigation in the year to June – and of them, 61 were aged 17 and under.. Across the rest of the UK, modern slavery referrals for suspected victims have also risen.. There were 14,600 in the year to June, and 5,800 of them were children – up from 11,600 and 5,200 respectively the year before.. The rise in cases comes as the Home Office revealed plans to restrict such claims to stop alleged \"abuse\" of the system.. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman received criticism for attributing the increase in modern slavery victims to migrants who were \"gaming the system\" by claiming asylum in the UK as victims of slavery, and reclassifying the crime as an \"illegal immigration and asylum\" issue, rather than a safeguarding one.. Potential cases are flagged through the National Referral Mechanism, which allows first responders, including local authorities, charities and certain government departments, to refer them to police forces for investigation.. Revealing plans to crack down on what she sees as fraudulent claims for asylum under the Modern Slavery Act, Ms Braverman said recently: \"The truth is that many of them are not modern slaves and their claims of being trafficked are lies.\". Since the new Home Office was formed, modern slavery has been listed as an \"illegal immigration and asylum\" issue overseen by the immigration minister, rather than under the duties of the safeguarding minister as before.. This has resulted in anti-slavery charities calling on the Government to stop \"distracting attention from the real criminals\".. Hope for Justice said Ms Braverman's reclassification of modern slavery is \"highly regressive\" and the shifting of responsibility will exacerbate the issue.. Meanwhile, anti-slavery charity Unseen said the numbers show there is still a long way to go to eradicate slavery in the UK and called on the Government to \"stop conflating modern slavery and immigration\".. \"The result is we’re treating vulnerable people as criminals when they most need our help, and distracting attention from the real criminals behind slavery and trafficking.\". The Home Office said it is \"committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery\" and that the National Referral Mechanism will continue to function in the same way.. Det Sgt Stu Peall of Lancashire Constabulary's human trafficking and modern slavery team said: “Modern slavery is a real issue, with those involved being exploited and controlled against their will for personal or commercial gain.. “Lancashire Constabulary is committed to investigating offences of modern slavery and we regularly carry out days or weeks of action, with surge activity focusing on arresting those responsible and safeguarding victims. This is also part and parcel of our daily business and is an issue we take very seriously.. “We welcome any community intelligence that can help to identify where modern slavery is taking place. If you have any information about suspicious activity, please let us know. We take all reports seriously and will investigate thoroughly.. You can either contact the police on 101, call 999 in an emergency or report information online at Lancashire Police's website.\n",

Mum who took in Ukrainian refugee reported for 'modern day slavery after asking her to do washing up'. Mum reported to police for 'modern day slavery' after asking Ukrainian lodger to wash up. A mum was left horrified when a Ukrainian refugee, who she had welcomed in to her home, reported her for modern day slavery after she asked her to wash up after her meal.. Hannah Debenham, who works as an NHS nurse, has now spoken out about the \" worst experience of her life\" after she was subjected to a traumatic two-month investigation following the complaints.. Hannah and her family were more than happy to rehome the refugees at their home in Uckfield, East Sussex, this summer amid their country's on-going war with Russia, the Mirror reports.. However, things quickly turned sour when the unnamed female refugee lodged a complaint with the police. The 42-year-old nurse has now spoken out about her ordeal after the case was finally dropped this week when no evidence was found.. Hannah says she has been left traumatised by the ordeal, which could have cost her her career. The mum-of-two said she was asked to 'voluntarily' attend Eastbourne police station in late July where she was then grilled by a modern-day slavery inspector. Her husband was later pulled in for questioning as well.. And now the nurse has warned others thinking about opening their homes to refugees to \"think twice\" following her distressing experience. She says she there was \"no gratitude, no care and no respect\" shown to her by the women they took in.. \"I've been an NHS mental health specialist for 15 years and I have often worked with people with severe mental illness supporting their needs in police custody, and this happening to me was the worst experience of my life.\". According to the police report, she was \"expected to clear up and tidy up the house for little to no money under the disguise of the Ukrainian settlement scheme\". The Ukrainian, who claimed she was also an English teacher, made contact after Mrs Debenham found her profile online. An agreement was reached that would allow the woman and her daughter, 10, to stay with them on the basis she would perform babysitting duties three days a week. For this, she would be paid £200. The report said she was 'made to work most days, looking after the children and expected to clear up and tidy up the house'. Det Chief Insp Patch says the force's investigation was concluded as quickly as possible. A Sussex Police statement read: \"Sussex Police received a report on July 20 of a person being required to perform forced or compulsory labour. The informant was a woman with a young daughter who had arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. \"On July 26, a woman from Uckfield, who had offered to host the pair, was invited to attend a voluntary interview at Eastbourne police station with her solicitor on August 16. She was not arrested. \"Following that interview, the informant was approached on several occasions to provide a full statement, but was not willing to assist with further enquiries or to provide a formal account. \"As a result, it was judged that there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution and no further action would be taken. The woman's solicitor was advised the same day of the decision.\". York trans woman stuck on NHS waiting list for 5 years wants £25,000 for private operation.

      "Knitted 'chains' in Worcestershire highlight modern slavery | Worcester News. Knitted 'chains' in Worcestershire highlight modern slavery. Worcester Diocesan Mothers’ Union has been working on a special campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery.. The group has joined 50 Mothers’ Union Groups and churches across the country to knit and crochet chains.. It comes as communities join together to raise awareness of the information from Worcester MU and the Clewer Initiative, which is partnered with the Mothers' Union.. There have also been displays and chains at Worcester Cathedral, Malvern Priory and at rural churches across the county.. Judith Grubb, Worcester Mothers’ Union diocesan president, said: “The Mothers' Union was particularly concerned about the trafficking of young girls and successfully campaigned for the 'Abolition of White Slavery Bill' in 1912, and the Mothers Union remains concerned about the trafficking of young girls as well as the lack of freedom for so many people in 2022.. “The MU work to improve society and strive for a stable family life for all, just as their founder Mary Sumner did, when she founded the Mothers' Union in 1876.”. Victims of modern slavery are mostly very vulnerable – they are forced, coerced, trapped and cannot escape..

      "UK's BSI issues guidance to eradicate modern slavery - Just Style. UK’s BSI issues guidance to eradicate modern slavery. The UK’s national standards body BSI has launched what it claims is the world’s first national standard to help organisations within the UK and globally to eradicate modern slavery in their supply chains.. Climate change, poverty contributing to modern slavery. The new standard: ‘BS 25700 Organizational Responses to Modern Slavery’, for use by international and UK organisations of all sizes, provides guidance on preventative measures, identifying, analysing, and evaluating exposure risks, approaches to address identified risks, remedying modern slavery practices, and reporting mechanisms.. Launched today (18 October) for Anti-Slavery Day, BSI says it hopes the new guidance will help organisations eradicate modern slavery in all forms.. “Global disruptions such as the pandemic and the return of war in Europe have created greater risks of modern slavery than those faced in 2015 when the Modern Slavery Act was enacted,” says Susan Taylor Martin, CEO, BSI. “Far more can be done to bridge the gap between policy and practice. BSI is committed to helping organisations understand what they can do in practical terms to eradicate this corrupt, criminal behaviour which continues to plague the global economy.”. Organisations are facing increased scrutiny over supply chain issues and their commitment to ensuring the wellbeing of people and planet and Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) reporting, BSI says. The modern slavery standard (BS 25700) provides “much needed guidance” for them to help identify risks, and the potential victims, of modern slavery, while offering pragmatic advice on how to address the issue.. In a pioneering move, the new standard will be available to all on an open-access basis.. Modern slavery describes a range of exploitative practices, including forced, compulsory and child labour, debt bondage and human trafficking. Rights and duties concerning modern slavery exist in UK legislation, notably through the Modern Slavery Act 2015, as well as through international frameworks including the United Nations and International Labour Organization (ILO).. The criminal practice affected 49.6 million people worldwide in 2021, according to estimates from Walk Free, the ILO and the International Organization for Migration, with 27.6 million people in forced labour. Criminals profiting from this make approximately US$150bn annually from the proceeds of these crimes.. “Too many organisations, large and small, may not fully understand the prevalence and locations of modern slavery in their supply chains and they may also lack knowledge on how to protect themselves from its risks,” adds Scott Steedman, director-general standards, BSI. “With this new National Standard BSI is providing much-needed guidance to help organisations act decisively to understand, identify risks, and eradicate modern slavery.”. As the National Standards Body in the UK, BSI helps businesses to adopt best practice frameworks aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, including supporting organisations in understanding and managing the risks of modern slavery.  It aims to bridge the gap between policy and practice – with a lack of compliance, inadequate modern slavery statements and gaps between what organisations say and do on the issue undermining existing requirements laid out in the Modern Slavery Act 2015.. In addition, whereas existing legislation requires organisations with an annual turnover of GBP36m (US$40.7m) or more to report on modern slavery, BS 25700 can be used by organisations of any size or type, which BSI says is critical given SMEs make up 99% of businesses and three-fifths of employment in the UK..

      "Trio guilty of modern slavery offences against vulnerable man | South Wales Argus. Trio sentenced for modern slavery offences after exploiting 'vulnerable' man. Trio guilty of modern slavery offences against vulnerable man. Normunds Freibergs, 40, of Morley Close, Newport, who was convicted of forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking offences and his accomplices Jakobus Stankevicius, 59, and Ruta Stankeviciene, 57, both of Capel Close, Newport. Picture: PA. TWO men have been jailed for modern slavery offences after their “vulnerable” victim was brought to Newport and forced to work.. Normunds Freibergs and Jokubas Stankevicius were handed prison sentences for exploiting Latvian national Rolands Kazoks between November 2017 and the following summer. Stankevicius' wife Ruta Stankeviciene received a suspended sentence.. The trio were all found guilty by a jury at Newport Crown Court in August of requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour.. Freibergs was also convicted of arranging or facilitating the travel of another person with a view to exploitation.. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mr Kazoks said: “When I came to the United Kingdom in 2017, it was to secure a better life for myself and my family back in Latvia.. Mr Kazoks said his father had become ill, in part due to the conditions he was living in.. Lowri Wynn Morgan, prosecuting, said Freibergs “enticed” the victim to move to the UK with the idea of working in a factory and promised him accommodation.. The court heard how Freibergs and Stankevicius took the victim’s passport and threatened him and his family. Freibergs also physically assaulted Mr Kazoks on one occasion.. Stankevicius, 59, had eight convictions for 21 offences, while 57-year-old Stankeviciene had two previous convictions for four offences.. Ms Wynn Morgan told the court the victim, who was being accommodated in a small room in the home of Stankevciene and Stankevicius, in Capel Crescent, was threatened with homelessness, as well as being deprived of being able to wash his clothes and of regular showers – while at the time working in a poultry factory.. He was denied access to his bank account, which Stankevicius and Stankeviciene controlled – with a total of £8,962 withdrawn between the three defendants. It was estimated Mr Kazoks had earned around £10,000 during that time.. “Save for the offences he is being convicted for, he has led since then a law-abiding life,” he said.. Mr Roberts said Freibergs had received “around £500” from the victim’s bank account.. “The agreement to lodge him at the home was made between [Freibergs] and her husband.. The defendant is a registered carer for his wife, he said, however he did add Stankevicius had “obviously a significant role” in the offending.. All three defendants continued to deny the offences they faced.. Judge Richard Williams said: “Rolands Kazoks is a hard-working man who looked to settle in the United Kingdom.. Judge Williams said Mr Kazoks “led a miserable and isolated existence” during these months.. Freibergs, 40, of Morley Close – who had no previous convictions – was sentenced to five years concurrently for each offence, while Stankevicius was handed a four-year prison sentence. Sentencing Stankeviciene, Judge Williams said: “I am aware you have a number of health issues and your mobility is restricted, albeit not to the extent you weren’t able to go to the cash machine on your mobility scooter and take money from the victim.”\n",

Modern slavery criminals in West Yorkshire rarely punished. The grim reality of exploitation as criminals are rarely brought to justice (Image: Picture). NEARLY 800 modern slavery offences were recorded by West Yorkshire Police in a three-year period – but just three per cent of cases resulted in a charge or summons.. Modern slavery is the illegal exploitation of people for personal or commercial gain.. It covers a wide range of abuse and exploitation including sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, forced labour, criminal exploitation and even organ harvesting.. Victims are tricked or threatened into work and may feel unable to leave or report the crime – they may not even recognise they are a victim.. Earlier this year, a safe space for victims of modern slavery opened in West Yorkshire.. According to the FOI figures, 796 Modern Slavery offences were recorded between January 2019 and December 2021 – 321 of those were in 2019; 252 were in 2020 and 223 were recorded last year.. West Yorkshire Police said it takes a “multifaceted” approach to human trafficking.. A dedicated team has also been created which deals with human trafficking at an organised crime level, while also supporting the district teams.. The spokesperson said: “The team have had specialist training in Human Trafficking both in force and from Partner Agencies such as Hope for Justice.”\n",

The Bishop of Bristol, the Rt Revd Vivienne Faull, speaks during a debate on human trafficking at a meeting of the General Synod in Church House, Westminster, in February. The Bishop of Bristol, the Rt Revd Vivienne Faull, speaks during a debate on human trafficking at a meeting of the General Synod in Church House, West.... THE former Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, was wrong to say that modern-slavery laws were being abused by people “gaming the system”, the Bishop of Bristol, the Rt Revd Vivienne Faull, has said.. In an article published on the Church Times website on Tuesday, Anti-Slavery Day, before Mrs Braverman resigned, Bishop Faull referred to Mrs Braverman’s speech at the Conservative Party Conference this month, in which the former Home Secretary said: “The hard truth is that our modern-slavery laws are being abused by people gaming the system. We’ve seen a 450-per-cent increase in modern-slavery claims since 2014.”. Bishop Faull wrote: “These statements increase damaging suspicion of genuine modern slavery victims, and they have also been found to be dubious.”. Bishop Faull also criticised the Government for failing to appoint its next Anti-Slavery Commissioner. “It is essential that this post is filled to allow the important work of monitoring the modern slavery sector, detecting and prosecuting offences, and maintaining essential relationships can continue at full capacity,” she writes.. She also wrote that the Nationality and Borders Act (News, 11 March) made it “significantly more challenging” for victims of modern slavery to access support services.. The Bishop commended the Clewer Initiative’s Make It Slavery Free campaign, which is “calling on churches, businesses, and individuals to deliver three anti-slavery actions this year”..

      "University of Dundee publishes report into slavery links | University of Dundee. Press release University of Dundee publishes report into slavery links. The University of Dundee has today published a report into the institution's historical links with transatlantic slavery.. The study acknowledges that whilst the University’s founders played a leading role in widening access to education by promoting the education of students of both sexes, Mary Ann Baxter and her family’s fortune was derived indirectly from slavery.. The Founders Project Final Report, authored by Dr Cassandra Gooptar from the University of Dundee, is the culmination of three months of intensive research designed to deepen understanding of Dundee’s role in Britain’s imperial past.. The University of Dundee has its roots in the University College Dundee, which was founded in 1881 with the donation of £140,000 from Mary Ann Baxter and her cousin, John Boyd Baxter. The report’s conclusion is that while the Baxters did not trade in or own slaves themselves, they were indirectly linked with slavery through the production and export of manufactured goods to transatlantic markets, and particularly clothing worn by enslaved people.. Principal and Vice-Chancellor Professor Iain Gillespie said, “This report offers an important opportunity to acknowledge an underexposed part of our history, and to recognise that we must all play a part in developing our collective memory.. “Although the University never owned enslaved people or traded in the goods they produced, it is now clear we received significant financial support from people whose wealth came indirectly from slavery. These histories have deep legacies and impact contemporary realities on campus and in wider society.. Nyasha Mutembwa, President of Dundee University Students’ Association, said, “Being someone that has been at this University since 2017 and now being in the position of the first black female President of the Students’ Association, it has been quite the journey to learn about this city’s history and people.. “As President of the African Caribbean Society in 2020, I had the pleasure of connecting with Cassandra and learning more about this project. I think this is a stepping stone for our University community to address historical issues and see how best to implement change in the world that we now live in.. “Being one of the many black students at this University I can only hope this new chapter allows us to reflect, educate and change for the better.”. Earlier this year the University signed a partnership commitment with universities in Malawi. The Blantyre Declaration, part of the University’s Africa Initiative, commits the University of Dundee to work with signatories to build more productive, sustainable and equitable long-term relationships that deliver social purpose, responding to the needs and opportunities identified through working with local communities.. Next month the University will unveil plans for an Africa lecture series, continuing its commitment to intellectual reparations, partnership and mutual exchange.. The programme will be designed to bring African leaders to Dundee to share in conversations and promote understanding. Professor Sosten Chiotha, Regional Director of LEAD Southern and Eastern Africa (Leadership for Environment and Development) and one of Malawi’s first Vision 2063 champions, will deliver the first lecture in the series.. The hybrid event will be free and open to audiences in Scotland and Africa, continuing the University’s commitment to public engagement, and helping to build a culture of openness to learning from others.. The University has also agreed a series of actions in response to the report’s recommendations including:. Explore opportunities for further focused archival research. Targeted engagement with African and Caribbean students and staff to discuss student experience on campus. The Principal will host an event next week at which there will be presentations, from speakers and academics including Dr Cassandra Gooptar and Professor Graham Fagan, and the University community will begin discussions about developing the action plan to move Dundee into a new era.. Professor Gillespie continued, “These actions build on work already underway, and I hope they provide a sense of determination and momentum to our commitment to equity and inclusion. I look forward to welcoming as many voices as possible into a conversation about how we can recognise and learn from our history.”. The University of Dundee is committed to addressing racial inequality and has outlined actions already underway as part of the University’s Race Charter Action Plan.. The launch event will add to a programme of events underway at the university to celebrate Black History Month and support engagement..
