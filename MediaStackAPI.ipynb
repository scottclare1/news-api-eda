      "Modern Warfare 2 is biggest Call Of Duty launch ever for PlayStation | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 is biggest Call Of Duty launch ever for PlayStation. Call Of Duty has got its mojo back (pic: Activision)Despite all the controversy over whether it’ll become an Xbox exclusive, the latest Call Of Duty is the fastest selling ever on PS4 and PS5.. According to Microsoft, they’re going to keep Call Of Duty multiformat ‘as long as there’s a PlayStation out there to ship to’, but many people don’t believe them. Just as they wouldn’t believe the promise of any corporation that wasn’t going to be held to account if they changed their tune.. Nevertheless, Xbox boss Phil Spencer is currently adamant that they won’t change their mind later and reason number one is pretty simple: because it sells the most on PlayStation 5 and 4. In fact, no Call Of Duty has sold more at launch than the new Modern Warfare 2.. Activision hasn’t released any figures, so it’s not clear how well it did on Xbox or exactly how many copies it sold on PlayStation, but supposedly it’s the biggest launch ever for both pre-orders and day one sales.. Although it’s not an official announcement as such, the suggestion that Modern Warfare 2 has done so well will be a huge relief to Activision as last year’s game, Vanguard, was one of the worst selling ever.. The success of Modern Warfare 2 likely means that Activision will steer away from the Second World War and other historical settings for the foreseeable future, although that wasn’t the only reason Vanguard wasn’t popular.. PS5 console sales reach 25 million but PS Plus subscriptions fall by 2 million. A very rough calculation, that assumes it cost $70 across all formats (in a significant proportion of cases it was probably less, especially on PC, so we’ve rounded down), suggests launch sales of 8+ million copies.. The failure of Vanguard was one of the main reasons that Activision Blizzard became cheap enough for Microsoft to comfortably afford it, but if anything were to go wrong with the acquisition – given both the UK and Europe are now investigating it more closely – Activision Blizzard would be a lot more expensive the next time round, if Microsoft had to make a second bid..

      "Meghan Markle reads a VERY strongly worded poem about letting go of a 'manic compulsion to be perfect' and an 'obsession to be voted popular' as she quotes celebrity parenting guru Dr Shefali Tsabary on her latest podcast. EXCLUSIVE: 'It has almost cost me my sanity': Animal rights protester who stood naked outside Harrods reveals the true toll of her activism... but her only regret is sharing her cause with 'pathetic' modern eco-zealotsHeidi Porter has no regrets about her activism, despite admitting it has 'cost me my sanity many times'But even she says the current eco zealots wreaking havoc on the streets of London are in the wrongShe said the new crop of activists turned on her because her own views didn't align exactly with theirs Ms Porter's comments come amid a month of chaos in the United Kingdom due to repeated protests By Brittany Chain For Mailonline. A vegan activist who staged countless protests throughout London has called out current eco-warriors for crossing a line in an attempt to get their message across.Heidi Porter has no regrets about her six years of activism, and still holds out hope she'll see the fruits of her labour in her lifetime, despite admitting it has 'cost me my sanity many, many times'.She protested the fur trade by standing naked outside Harrods almost every day for a year in 2015, paid upwards of £10,000 to advertise her cause and 'has never fully recovered from the physical toll of her vegan diet,' she said. The mother and childcare worker has done everything in her power to promote veganism. But even she says the current eco zealots who are wreaking havoc on the streets of London need to be stopped. Or at the very least, redirected.'Just when the whole world views vegans as nutty fruitcakes you had to go and prove them right by raining on the Queen's parade,' she said, criticising a protest which interrupted the late Queen's platinum jubilee earlier this year.'Never have I ever regretted flying the flag for vegans as much as I do now after seeing this pathetic and unacceptable attempt at protesting. Back in my day at least we had the common decency to show some respect and dignity.'. She protested the fur trade by standing naked outside Harrods almost every day for a year in 2015, paid upwards of £10,000 to advertise for her cause and lost her hair as a result of her vegan diet. The mother and childcare worker has done everything in her power to promote veganism. But even she says the current eco zealots who are wreaking havoc on the streets of London need to be stopped. Or at the very least, redirectedShe told MailOnline the new crop of activists turned on her because her own views didn't align exactly with theirs, noting she'd been subjected to 'trolling by fellow vegans because I refused to follow them and their own individual, personal beliefs'.'I once faced a barrage of abuse because I used the word 'pet' to describe my cat - and I was recently turned on again because I said that I wanted to try the new vegan burger at McDonalds,' she said.Ms Porter gave a detailed rundown of her activism work over the years, and while it's led to tension within her family and friendship circles, she maintained she has always been respectful of the public's time and property.'To be a protester you have to think outside the box a little, you've got to reel people into the cause. If all you're going to do is annoy people, you're not going to get anyone on side,' she said.'We're making headway right now but doing it in the wrong way. I don't agree with the oil protests, interrupting people, stopping ambulances from getting through or destroying property... It's not something I would do.'. Ms Porter gave a detailed rundown of her activism work over the years, and while it's led to tension within her family and friendship circles, she maintained she has always been respectful of the public's time and property. She fears she won't see the end of the fur trade in her lifetime, but remains hopeful for changeMs Porter said she admires that people are willing to open themselves up to scrutiny for their beliefs, but said the current protests aren't something she'd ever put her name to.'I don't think they're going about it the right way,' she said. Of her own activism, Ms Porter said her husband refers to it as a 'mid-life crisis'. In 2015, Ms Porter spent 'the whole year protesting naked outside Harrods and Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge, London'.She recalled most weeks she conducted the protest alone, and eventually caught pneumonia from spending so much time in the freezing cold.'I was hospitalised for five days and nearly died... This act of heroism also cost me precious time away from my small children that I will never get back.' Later, she chose to give up eating Kellogg's Coco Pops because the brand could not guarantee they were 100 per cent vegan, and this eventually spiralled into her 'almost stopping eating altogether because [she] was so scared to accidentally eat something that contained animal products'.. Ms Porter's activism is often shocking and she wants it to lead to discussion - but she says she did not go out of her way to cause major disruption like current protesters. Supporters of Just Stop Oil (JSO) disrupt traffic as they march along Whitehall on October 3'I quickly lost weight and my hair started to fall out, forcing me to resort to wearing wigs to hide the loss,' she said.'To this day, I have never fully recovered from the physical toll my vegan diet has taken on my overall personal health and appearance.'In total, Ms Porter has spent more than £10,000 to promote her activism, including through photoshoots, fliers and public advertisements.'Despite all this, it continues to be both my immense blessing and my absolute curse,' she said. Ms Porter's comments come amid a month of chaos in London and the wider United Kingdom due to repeated Just Stop Oil demonstrations.\n",

Tens of thousands of Ukranians were welcomed to the UK after the war with Russia began. Please enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy noticeA mother-of-two was investigated for “modern slavery” after a Ukrainian refugee she was hosting in the UK complained to the police. Hannah Debenham and her husband invited the woman and her 10 year-old daughter to stay at their home in Sussex under the Homes for Ukraine scheme in June. Ms Debenham says they had made an arrangement that the woman would provide babysitting services a few days a week, for £200. But the NHS mental health specialist said that after a “honeymoon period” the arrangement soon broke down, with the host claiming the family did not clean up after themselves.On 20 July, Sussex Police received a report “of a person being required to perform forced or compulsory labour”.Has your hosting arrangement broken down? If so email holly.bancroft@independent.co.ukRecommendedUkraine: Blackouts back in Kyiv as war takes multiple frontsZelensky accuses Russian commanders of ‘crazy’ tactics to escalate war in UkraineGermany needs to stop apologising and defend its record with RussiaMs Debenham was interviewed by police during a weeks-long investigation that eventually found no evidence of any wrongdoing. The force said the complainant refused to provide a full statement or assist with further enquiries. The Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched by the government in March but concerns have been raised by charities about an increasing number of families presenting as homeless as hosting arrangements end or break down. Speaking out about the ordeal, Ms Debenham told Mail Online the police investigation was “the worst experience of her life”.”It was just devastating,” she said. “We just wanted to help.

      "Modern Warfare 2 menu and UI the ‘absolute worst’ according to fans | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 menu and UI the ‘absolute worst’ according to its own players. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – do you find the game’s menus too confusing to navigate? (pic: Activision)Disgruntled Call Of Duty fans have taken umbrage with Modern Warfare 2’s menu system and unfavourably comparing it to Hulu.. For as much of a money maker as the Call Of Duty franchise is for Activision, it sometimes seems as if its own player-base doesn’t actually like it.. Now that Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been released, Xbox players are bemoaning the forced crossplay (something PlayStation owners don’t have to worry about) and plenty are taking issue with the game’s menus.. This was already a frequent complaint during Modern Warfare 2’s beta, but it seems Infinity Ward hasn’t done enough to fix things.. On Reddit, one ghostghost31 says Modern Warfare 2 has the ‘absolute worst UI I’ve ever come across.’. They explain how they struggled to find the right gameplay mode they wanted, since there’s no option to filter them from the lobby.. ‘It’s truly baffling to me why it’s set up like this,’ they say. ‘Why can’t I change filters from the lobby screen like we always have? What is the difference between Quick Play and Invasion?’. ‘It’s truly mind-boggling how bad it can be,’ adds justthisones. ‘The campaign sits weirdly in between all modes in the main menu too.’. They even suggest that the menu is ‘un-video game like’ and made by people who don’t know anything about games.. If some fans’ claims are accurate, that may be the case, as it’s been suggested that Infinity Ward hired the same person who designed the user interfaces for US streaming service Hulu.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – there are also separate tabs for Social and Channels/Party, which seems oddly unnecessary (pic: Reddit)‘I’m pretty sure they paid the guys who designed Hulu’s UI,’ claims Brodias_Johnson. ‘I mean the UI was getting a bit boring but you didn’t need to f*** it up this bad.’. That’s not the only Reddit thread either. Always-Panic (who shared the above picture) describes the menu as ‘the worst UI in a Call Of Duty game so far’ since everything – including the multiplayer modes and campaign mode – share a single menu, rather than being separated into individual ones.. A common complaint is that the menu itself resembles more what you’d see for a streaming service, where all the options are displayed as giant blocks, which only adds to the Hulu comparisons.. ‘I read somewhere that the UI/UX devs are ex Hulu devs,’ says Polidamn. ‘When you look at it, it makes sense (all blocky like you are looking for your next show to watch). They developed what they knew, a streaming platform and not a video game. Hence why it’s trash.’.

      "Turning off crossplay in Modern Warfare 2 is a PS4 and PS5 exclusive | Metro News. Turning off crossplay in Modern Warfare 2 is a PS4 and PS5 exclusive. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – no word yet on whether this is intentional or not (pic: Activision)Aside from other launch day issues, Modern Warfare 2 fans are stunned to learn they can’t turn off crossplay unless they’re on PlayStation.. Although Call Of Duty is on its way to becoming an Xbox franchise, Sony and Activision’s contract means the series continues to have some PlayStation exclusive benefits.. For Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, this meant PlayStation owners had early access to the beta, but there aren’t any special features for the PlayStation versions that aren’t also available for the Xbox and PC.. Or so you would think, as players have been discovering that Modern Warfare 2’s crossplay option can only be disabled on the PlayStation version.. What this means is that Xbox and PC players have no choice but to play with those on other platforms, whereas PlayStation users can opt out.. There’s nothing official to suggest that this is part of the deal between Sony and Activision, but it is bizarre that the PlayStation version is the only one that allows you to switch crossplay off.. For years crossplay was a long-demanded feature and is now quite commonplace, but many console gamers have found that it’s a double-edged sword.. PlayStation and Xbox owners are happy to play together but they’re often unhappy about competing with PC owners, given the increased accuracy of a keyboard and mouse set-up over using a joypad.. Even those that don’t consider that an issue are wary of the fact that it’s much easier to run cheats on a PC, compared to a console.. Where is the crossplay turn off option Xbox? Yall serious?. how come the toggle has been removed to allow/disable console crossplay with pc?Now the only option I have is to use my xbox settings to disable all crossplay which means I canât play with my PlayStation friends anymore.#CallofDuty #ModernWarfare2— Tony Stone (@TonusStonus) October 28, 2022. @CallofDuty @InfinityWard @ATVIAssist @Activision Why canât I turn off crossplay?

Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – unlike Call Of Duty: Warzone, the newest release still offers local play (pic: Activision)Local split-screen multiplayer is thankfully still a thing in Modern Warfare 2, but there are a couple hurdles to getting it working.. For all of Call Of Duty’s faults (and depending on who you ask, there are many), it’s yet to discard local split-screen multiplayer even as the games industry attempts to push for purely online experiences.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is no different, so if you have a friend round and you want to play the game together, they don’t have to bring their console or PC with them.. In case you need a refresher, or this is your first Call Of Duty, here’s how you can get local split-screen multiplayer working in Modern Warfare 2.. How to play local split-screen multiplayer in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Firstly, it should be stated that, at the time of writing, split-screen multiplayer is only something that can be done on the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game.. Previous PC releases of Call Of Duty games didn’t feature split-screen multiplayer and since it was absent from the beta for Modern Warfare 2, it’s safe to assume that it won’t come to the new game either. Unless Activision says otherwise.. Once you’ve got the game booted up on your console of choice, make your way to the multiplayer menu.. There, all you need to do is connect a second controller to the console. However, the second player will need to then log in with their Activision account.. This won’t be a problem if they own the game themselves, but it is a hurdle for anyone who doesn’t regularly play the Call Of Duty series. So, make sure your friend has an Activision account set up beforehand.. If you’re planning to play against others online together, both of you will also need an active PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live subscription. Ikea threatens legal action over indie horror game not set in IkeaCan you play Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s campaign in co-op?. Unfortunately, no. The campaign is a purely single-player experience, so you have to play it alone.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is available for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC..

Sounds like Task Force 141 still have a job to do (pic: Activision)Rather than wait for the sequel, fans of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 can look forward to more story content via a series of raids.. Chances are you’ve already played and completed Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s campaign. Assuming you pre-ordered the game beforehand and got early access to the mode.. If you thought that was all done and dusted, though, you may be surprised to learn that Activision and Infinity Ward will keep the story going through post-launch updates.. Specifically, a Raids mode is scheduled to arrive on December 14 and will tie up some loose ends left hanging from the campaign.. Raids were already confirmed for the game last month, and were described as a ‘three-player cooperative experience requiring teamwork and strategic, puzzle-solving thinking in-between bouts of intense combat.’. It turns out it’s not some standalone mode unconnected to anything, but a continuation of the Modern Warfare 2 storyline.. New raids will be introduced each season, with the first episode to arrive alongside the Special Ops mode.. RAIDS arrive in @CallofDuty later this year. Following the events of the #MWII campaign, each seasonal phase will advance our ongoing story, as old friends and new enemies tie-up loose ends…More information to follow.— Infinity Ward (@InfinityWard) October 26, 2022. Infinity Ward is still coy about the exact details and have yet to show any gameplay, or even say which of the campaign’s characters will make an appearance.. While raids are quite commonplace among other multiplayer titles, such as Bungie’s Destiny games, this marks the first time they will be featured in a Call Of Duty game.. As such, it’ll be interesting to see how Infinity Ward approaches them. If it proves popular enough, perhaps raids will be implemented in other future Call Of Duty titles.. Resident Evil Re:Verse review – a multiplayer biohazard.

      "COD: Modern Warfare 2 review in progress – MW2: Moderner Warfare | Metro News. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 review in progress – MW2: Moderner Warfare. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – another year, another COD (pic: Activision)The latest Call Of Duty is both a sequel and a reboot but with no real competition this year is it sitting on its laurels or taking advantage of an open goal?. As you might imagine, the reason we’re bringing this up is because Modern Warfare 2 has gone for option number two. Last year’s Call Of Duty: Vanguard was one of 2021’s most successful games but it was also a commerical disappointment that promoted a narrative that Call Of Duty as a whole was starting to become old hat. (Its relative failure is the reason Activision Blizzard became cheap enough for Microsoft to try and purchase.). Viewed on its own merits, Vanguard was not a bad game – no Call Of Duty ever has been – but half the problem was that its Second World War setting just didn’t resonate anymore, especially as Warzone was forced to replicate it. That seemed to make the wait until the next game longer than usual, but here it is: the series’ second Modern Warfare 2 and another Call Of Duty game that is exactly what you expect and not an smidgen more.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 single-player review. This isn’t a final review because the multiplayer servers only switched on the night of the launch and our experience with the PvP mode comes from the beta. Plus, we haven’t played the co-op Special Ops mode at all (there is no Zombies mode), so that will have to wait until later.. If you’re a committed Call Of Duty fan then you’ve probably already played the single-player campaign, since if you pre-ordered the game you were able to access it a week early. That’s not something Activision has done before and it’s not entirely obvious why they did. It does illustrate how good the graphics are – easily the best the series has ever seen – and showcases the new modern armoury, but in terms of storytelling and mission design it’s harder to be impressed.. Technically, this is a sequel to 2019’s reboot of the Modern Warfare series, but while that game was only a very loose interpretation of the 2007 original, for some reason the Modern Warfare 2 reboot is a lot closer to its 2009 inspiration (whose campaign was remastered only a couple of years ago). It’s not exactly the same, as much of the game is set in Mexico, but the broad strokes of the plot, and many of the set pieces, are very familiar.. This is a disappointment on two fronts, not just in the sense of the unoriginality of it all but the fact that the first Modern Warfare reboot had notably more serious storytelling than any of the other games, and actually allowed some nuance in the portrayal of its characters and the amorality of war. However, the new Modern Warfare 2 is straight back to Michael Bay style bombast and nonsense, and we’re not sure why.. Oddly, the new Modern Warfare 2 is also obsessed with reimagining missions from the first Modern Warfare, even though its reboot didn’t go in for that sort of fan service. That means levels inspired by not just Crew Expendable and Clean House but the iconic Death From Above and All Ghilled Up. They still work the same way they did in the naughties, as you control a ‘TV operator’ in an overhead gunship, raining death upon hapless foes below, and then later end up sneaking around in a ghillie suit, as bad guys pass by inches from your position.. In the original game these missions were surprisingly brief and like nothing that had ever been seen at the time. In the new Modern Warfare 2 though, they go on for far too long and, since they occur very early in the campaign, create a sinking feeling that bold new ideas are not on the game’s agenda.. Unfortunately, that impression is entirely correct as while the campaign does highlight new features from the multiplayer, such as swimming underwater, it never manages to find a compelling way to do it. Most of the levels take place in small (much smaller than you first think) open world areas and yet the amount of downtime and poor signposting is shocking. You’ll spend far more time wandering around, not sure what to do or where that last enemy is, than you will shooting anyone, especially in the first half of the campaign.. Some of the sequences do look stunning (the Amsterdam level is amazing) but they’re barely any more than interactive cut scenes and probably would’ve been more entertaining as QTEs. Other missions have good ideas, such as the one where you’re unarmed and trying to sneak out of an occupied town while crafting boobytraps, but even that is spoiled by the fact that you’re injured and move at a snail’s pace.. Other new ideas, like armoured enemies, are presumably realistic and yet feel strangely artificial and overly video game-y, with the little icons indicating whether you’ve pierced someone’s armour. Ultimately, the best new mission is probably the one where you’re trying to bluff your way into a drug lord’s mansion, not least because it’s short enough that it doesn’t overstay its welcome.. At little more than six hours, the campaign isn’t a waste of your time, but it’s too obsessed with recreating the past, while missing much of what made the older games so effective. In the end, we suspect the main reason for releasing it early was that Activision knew most people would get bored and give up within half an hour, never to return, if it had launched at the same time as the multiplayer.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – no surprises (pic: Activision)Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer review. The reason there’s never been a truly bad Call Of Duty game is simple: the series’ gunplay (which has always been 60fps, for those who now suddenly consider that important) has always been excellent. Playing soldiers is a primal, human desire and while some entries have been better than others, running around, pretending to shoot people is always irresistible entertainment. Especially when combined with the action and endless array of modes and options in Call Of Duty.. We’re sure there are some fans planning to lecture others about how much better this is than last year’s Vanguard but the truth is that, apart from the change in setting and weapons, the two work very similarly. Modern Warfare 2 has a slightly faster pace to its combat, and the map design and operators are much better, but there are no big new ideas here and this is most certainly not Call Of Duty’s Breath Of The Wild moment.. The map design may be the best element of the new game, as it’s often very clever about how it manipulates the pacing of a match. Call Of Duty has a reputation for just being a free-for-all but on the best of Modern Warfare 2’s maps running around like a kid with a supersoaker will get you absolutely nowhere. A lack of caution is always fatal, with the best advise being to keep moving and always assume someone can see you, as you’re made to work for your killstreaks.. Farm 18 was one of our favourite maps from the beta, with its maze of buildings, as well as Mercado Las Almas and it’s tempting hub area that it funnels unwary players towards. Good map design can make even familiar modes seem fresh, which is just as well as new additions like Knock Out and Prisoner Rescue are just minor variations of modes you will have experienced a thousand times before. Even the third person moshpit isn’t technically new (Modern Warfare 3 also had a third person mode) and is really only Team Deathmatch with a different camera.. New or old, the standard game modes are exactly that, but the closest Modern Warfare 2 comes to innovation is in its larger maps, which allow for 64 players at a time. This opens up additional modes like Invasion and Ground War, which are the most fun we’ve had with the multiplayer so far. Invasion is brand new and is essentially Team Deathmatch with computer-controlled bots added on top, but it works great with the new and expansive maps.. Saturnalia review - getting away from it allGround War has been in Call Of Duty before but it’s never worked quite this well. It’s still an objective based team game but the map design is, again, excellent and the vehicles are the best they’ve ever been in a Call Of Duty game. Considering the mode is essentially identical to Battlefield’s Domination, it’s only going to drive the nails into Battlefield 2042’s coffin even harder.. It really doesn’t matter that the campaign is so mediocre. Most recent ones have been and it’s only the fact that the first Modern Warfare reboot broke the mould that makes this a disappointment. There are improvements, and a few detractions, here but there’re not nearly enough mistakes to ruin the game’s appeal. You know what to expect with Call Of Duty and with Modern Warfare 2 you get exactly that, and no more.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 review summary. In Short: A mild disappointment compared to the first Modern Warfare reboot, that relies too much on nostalgia and old ideas, but the core action and multiplayer modes are as irresistible as ever.. Pros: Fantastic gunplay and highly impressive graphics. A mountain of modes and options, and the map design and vehicles in multiplayer are top notch. Tons of content, including co-op Special Ops.. Cons: The campaign fumbles its few innovations and doesn’t seem to understand why the originals worked so well. Multiplayer is fundamentally the same as always..

      "Games Inbox: Is Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 worth getting? | Metro News. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – it’s that time of year again (pic: Activision)The Friday letters page continues the arguments of 30fps vs. 60fps (and 40fps), as one reader admits to enjoying Gotham Knights.. Please be moderately excitedSo it’s launch day on Friday for Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and I’m… moderately excited? I’m not expecting any big surprises, in fact I know there aren’t any, but I pre-ordered and I’ve played the campaign and the beta, and I thought it was all pretty good.. I’m not sure why the campaign was cribbing so much from the first Modern Warfare but overall I enjoyed it and I was really impressed by the graphics. Some of the best I’ve seen this generation and while there was still some uncanny valley going on with the characters they’re still really impressive.. Ire discrepancySo with the uproar regarding Gotham Knights not running at 60fps and some people’s ire at this I have a question….. I just found out that this game also runs at 30fps – with apparently the PlayStation 5 occasionally dipping to 24fps (this is running at 1440p upscaled to 4K).. Now personally I’m not that fussed, as I said previously, I will normally take pretty graphics over frame rate, just wondered why Gotham Knights seem to be taking all the flack when it seems it’s not an outlier?. I have seen an article that suggests the issue isn’t actually the Xbox Series S (again, Requiem just runs on Xbox Series S at 1080p rather than 1440p), but rather, in order to get all the loveliness out of Unreal 5 just requires so much CPU and GPU horsepower! So potentially the issue is Unreal 5, or at least using its more intensive features.. GC: A Plague Tale: Requiem was mentioned in yesterday’s Inbox. But as you say, 30fps has been the standard for decades. It’s absolutely fine for a game like Requiem, where one of the central appeals are its detailed visuals – which would not be possible on current hardware if it had to run at 60fps.. The gathering stormI think since NTSC vs. PAL I can remember some debate about the frame rate of games, with higher rates largely considered better. Console gaming has been a predominately 30fps affair for some time. But the mid-gen upgrades last gen planted the notion of PC style options into many a gamer’s head. Where they could choose between the desired 60fps over graphics.. The new consoles delivered this promise in spades, with excellent upgrade patches and performance options. I’ve had my Xbox Series X for 18 months and my PlayStation 5 for 11 months and aside from Microsoft Flight Simulator, A Plague Tale: Requiem is the first game on the current gen where I’ve been locked again to 30 fps (40-ish fps if you have a 120Hz display). I’ve played every game on console at 60fps for a year and half now.. So I don’t think anyone has decided in a couple weeks 30fps is unpayable. It’s just the cats out of the bag for some gamers. They’ve got used to 60fps, they can switch between performance and fidelity mode in a second and see the difference. The reader yesterday could switch between games in a flash to compare with quick resume. This is why a locked 30fps game on the new consoles is getting talked about a lot.. Digital Foundry had an article saying a return to 30fps on console was inevitable. A longer than usual cross-gen period and few next gen exclusives that really push the consoles meant 60fps wasn’t too much trouble for the new consoles. But as consoles are relatively cheap bits of kit compared to a high-end CPUs and GPUs it was only a matter of time before there would be games that the consoles couldn’t run at 60fps, even with reduced graphics.Simundo. 40 > 30Regarding A Plague Tale: Requiem and 30 frames per second.. If you have a TV that supports VRR you can use it to play Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 games to up the frame rates of games that support it.. I played through Ratchet & Clank and A Plague Tale: Requiem and those extra 10 frames really do make a huge difference, I couldn’t really tell it apart from 60fps, whereas the jump from 30 to 40 was very noticeable.JDB. Better than middlingI might be the only one, but I picked up a copy of Gotham Knights despite the mostly fair-to-middling reviews it seems to have got everywhere and I really like it. Yes, it is very different from any of the Arkham games, but I did expect it to be different without Rocksteady being involved.. I think that the best description I have read is that it’s like when the Assassin’s Creed games moved to more of a role-playing style of game, and I think that sums it up perfectly. Call me a glutton for punishment but I also picked up a copy of Saints Row, which is much better than I expected. It’s just big dumb fun and sometimes you need that from a game.Rickandrolla (PSN ID). Maybe this will be the franchise’s breakout Persona 5 moment. I actually think it’s smart counter programming from Nintendo, to put it out against Call of Duty, like when movie distributors put out an arthouse film at the same time as some big blockbuster. They know a certain demographic of people will be looking for an alternative at the cinema and have movies on their mind.Marc.

      "Modern Warfare 2 weapon camos: release date, challenges and mastery | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 weapon camos: release date, challenges and mastery. Get yourself some weapon camo bling (pic: Activision)Unlocking rare weapon camos is one of the most complicated challenges in Modern Warfare 2 but all it needs is a little hard work.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is out soon and that means a whole new game filled with items and rewards to unlock, including weapon camos.. Activision has managed to maintain some mystery around what the full game will contain, despite suffering a few leaks – including two popular footballers’ operator skins.. However, if you’re still not convinced Modern Warfare 2 will manage to keep you entertained after the first wave of excitement passes, you might want to take a look at the shiny weapon camo challenges that will be available at launch.. Depending on the camo you have equipped, other players can tell how good a player you are, meaning that the rarer the camo the more bragging rights you’ll have.. On your feet, soldier! Here is your mission checklist for the launch of #MWII. ✅ Complete the Campaign✅ Reach Military Rank 55✅ Unlock all weapons and attachments✅ Get at least one Special Ops Kit to Tier 5✅ Unlock all operators✅ Begin the Weapon Mastery journey. — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) October 26, 2022. You’ll start with earning base-tier camo rewards, with the end goal being to unlock mastery camos featuring four unique designs: gold, platinum, polyatomic, and orion.. Any weapon can equip a base camo once unlocked, which is usually specific to that weapon. In other words, base camos will be available across all weapons by completing a challenge on the road to a weapon’s first mastery camo.. There will be over a hundred base camos available at launch, with more arriving with each new weapon that gets added to the game in later seasons.. Unlike base camos, which are universally available, mastery camos are unlocked for only a specific weapon – making them far more desirable.. Various base camos equipped on the M4 (pic: Activision)Here’s what we know so far about how you can progress through the camo challenges, to eventually unlock the rarest bracket of rewards.. Every weapon has four base camo challenges, which will include things like a basic kill count challenge, kills without reloading, double kills, triple kills, and more. Weapons without attachments, such as the RPG-7, have only one base challenge, so you might want to start there.. If you complete all the base challenges, you unlock the first mastery challenge for gold camo, and so on and so forth.. After gold comes platinum, which is tied to specific weapon categories, and its challenges will become available once a certain number of gold camos within a weapon category are acquired.. So far, it doesn’t sound too daunting, though you might end up in a pickle once it’s time to unlock weapon camos in the polyatomic category..

However, Modern Warfare 2 will throw you a bone after this, by granting you orion camos for each weapon that you’ve equipped with polyatomic.. Each Mastery camo is also tied to an extra challenge required for weapon mastery, which can be done in parallel with your camo challenge journey.. The Weapon Mastery challenges will involve getting a set number of kills with a weapon while a specific mastery weapon camo, e.g. gold camo, is equipped..

Log in‘Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'Release date: 28 October 2022Publisher: ActivisionDeveloper: Infinity WardAge rating: 18+Buy for £59.99The latest game in the series follows the covert exploits of Task Force 141 and Mexican Special Forces, working in a joint operation against the (fictional) terrorist cell Al-Qatala, which has managed to come into possession of American-made missiles and is working with the (again, fictional) drug cartel Las Almas.Throughout the campaign’s 18-or-so missions, the joint special forces teams conduct operations across various fictional and real-life locations, such as Amsterdam, Mexico and Spain, along with fictionalised regions peppered in for good measure, such as Urzikstan and the United Republic of Adal, if only to erect straw men, onto which Modern Warfare 2 can project its ideals.Read more: The Callisto Protocol hands-on previewModern Warfare 2 does its best to make each of these excursions around the globe feel distinct enough, with a handful of standout moments where the tried-and-tested Call of Duty formula is given a chance to stretch its legs. Extended stealth sequences, where player characters have to find supplies to construct makeshift mines, flash grenades and weapons, feel like a far cry from the series’s usual penchant for the bombastic, but these are few and far between.Where Modern Warfare 2’s campaign really strains is in its attempts to recapture lightning-in-a-bottle moments. One of the standout moments from 2019’s Modern Warfare was the mission “Clean House”, which saw an SAS team conduct a raid on a London townhouse occupied by a terrorist group.Read more: Bayonetta 3 review for Nintendo SwitchIt was a slow, methodical crawl that was of particular note for its subdued approach to “realistic” engagement, and that sentiment seems to have carried over to its sequel. Similarly conducted missions in the latest game feel less like an undercover operation and more like a slow-moving shooting gallery. Doors pop open and enemies pile out but that sense of tension is hard to maintain when it happens with great abundance.One level in particular makes a concerted effort to recreate the “All Ghillied Up” level, which is often seen as one of the most notable highlights from the original Modern Warfare. But in doing so, it fails to recapture the same energy of crawling behind enemy lines within a few feet of enemy soldiers – instead creating an overly expansive map that fails to suitably punish players for getting caught in the act.Read more: Best deals on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2Similarly, taking over the controls of a gunship to clear out farms, “hacking” into security cameras to guide operators through patrolling guards and calling in drone strikes from a distance all bear a familiar resemblance to previous iterations, without improving on those moments. It’s like a “greatest hits” compilation, comprised of the series’s B-side tracklist. While the series has deeply rooted itself in the collective conscience of gaming, for better or worse, its insistence on making reference to (arguably) its most controversial moment in the franchise as a Marvel-style sting for an expected sequel may leave those old enough to remember the original Modern Warfare 2 with a bitter taste in their mouths.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£59.99 Amazon.co.ukBuy nowBack to topThe verdict: ‘Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’If Vanguard was seen as a disappointing misstep by fans (and even Activision’s own expectations), Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2’s attempts to bring the franchise away from its Second World War setting will likely be met with relief. But though it still continues to offer some decent first-person shooting, its campaign offers a lacklustre experience that is ultimately hard to shake.Plenty of Call of Duty fans may well forgo the campaign in its entirety to focus on its multiplayer and Warzone 2 content, but don’t expect the single-player to be the sole worth of this instalment.

      "Pogba and Neymar look better in Modern Warfare 2 than in FIFA 23 | Metro News. Pogba and Neymar look better in Modern Warfare 2 than in FIFA 23. Would you pick them in-game to run around Al Mazrah? (pic: Metro.co.uk)A new leak has revealed Paul Pogba and Neymar’s skins in Modern Warfare 2 and some think they look better than their FIFA 23 counterparts.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is only hours away from going live, yet it’s been hit with a major leak that’s unveiled two highly anticipated operator skins.. It was only a few weeks ago when players got wind of an unexpected crossover, that would see real-life footballers make an appearance in Modern Warfare 2.. The reports claimed that many popular football stars, including Messi, would soon get a Call Of Duty makeover, and now that’s been confirmed with another leak showing Paul Pogba and Neymar’s skins in the game.. Between the Snoop Dog skin for Vanguard and the Terminator ones for Warzone, the franchise is no stranger to crossovers that aren’t strictly military-related.. A more recent example of that would be Modern Warfare 2’s collaboration with Burger King for the Burger Town operator skin, which isn’t available in the UK – though you can still snatch the Papa John’s one.. Only a few hours ago, leaked pictures surfaced showing exactly how Neymar and Paul Pogba will look in-game, adding to the list of offbeat crossovers.. They’re seen rocking some camouflaged military gear, so don’t expect them to be running around in their football kits.. When I first heard about it I thought they’d be in kit, slightly disappointed now ngl ð­— Hennzo (@hjhbxd) October 27, 2022. Although FIFA 23’s high-tech face-scanning mechanism has been praised by many, not everyone’s impressed with how their favourite footballers look in-game.. One Twitter user joked that Modern Warfare 2 managed to get a better scan of Paul Pogba’s face than FIFA did, and another added that this is how they should be looking in the first place.. They managed to get a better scan of Pogba here than FIFA ever has. How they should be looking in Fifa too 😭😤. Both Pogba and Neymar’s digital copies in Modern Warfare 2 look quite realistic when compared to their real-life counterparts, and with a proper 4K setup on your PC or next-gen console, they might look even better.. Many football fans have also rushed to crack jokes at the footballers’ expense, referring to their rather dramatic escapades when they’re on the field (diving, we’re talking about diving!). Though it would be quite funny if Infinity Ward chose to incorporate them in Modern Warfare 2’s gameplay options.. Pogba’s getting injured before he even gets shot, and this will be Neymar’s emote: pic.twitter.com/UGeJcO3D7t. Ikea threatens legal action over indie horror game not set in IkeaActivision hasn’t confirmed whether these skins will be available on launch, or at a later time, joining the likes of certain Special Ops features, and possibly a Zombie special.. Moreover, it wouldn’t be surprising if Pogba and Neymar’s skin make it to Warzone 2.0 when it finally drops on Wednesday, November 16..

      "Modern Warfare 2 players warned not to switch regions for early access | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 players warned not to change regions for early access – but they’ll still do it. They’re not changing their minds (pic: Activision)You might want to think twice if you were planning on changing your location to access Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer early, warns Infinity Ward.. After months of anticipation, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will finally launch in less than 24 hours across all platforms. Naturally, many players are keen to find ways to access the game even earlier, to get a taste of the new campaign and multiplayer.. One cheeky method that you can use is to change your digital location to New Zealand, to unlock the game as soon as the date changes in the country, even if you’re on the other side of the globe.. As this isn’t an uncommon practice amongst the gaming community, Infinity Ward has decided to issue a warning to dissuade players from doing it, by putting out a ‘launch PSA.’. Through a post on Twitter, developers warned that if you try to alter your digital location, you’ll experience ‘connectivity issues’ and you might be ‘locked out’ of the game until the official launch time hits your region.. Launch PSA: If you are trying to change your consoleâs region setting in order to access #MWII early, you will experience connectivity issues and may be locked out of the game until the official launch time of your region.— Infinity Ward (@InfinityWard) October 27, 2022. That means you’ll likely be locked out of the game’s campaign mode too, leaving you still having to wait till the game’s launch time in your region.. Seeing Infinity Ward’s announcement, some players were eager to leave comments, criticising the whole concept of regional rollouts.. However, another player jumped in and defended Infinity Ward, as he pointed out that Overwatch 2 suffered from long queue times during launch, due to releasing the game across all platforms at once.. Howâs that ridiculous? It would be another overwatch 2 situation where no one could log in and thereâs ques of 100k+ for hours lol.— Frank (@GuessIWasRight) October 27, 2022. Others argued that the devs’ message was directed at PlayStation, rather than Xbox users, pointing out it’s easy to switch regions on the latter without any consequences.. Lmao nah towards Xbox, PlayStation canât just switch regions without making a new account unlike Xbox which can do that— ALÂ¥X (@ThatGuyAlyx) October 27, 2022. One player proudly admitted that he’s already switched his region to New Zealand on his Xbox, proving it’s not difficult there either.. Yet another reason for players wanting a universal release is the fact that when they finally access Modern Warfare 2, they’d be ‘getting smoked’ by people levels ahead of them, who accessed the game earlier.. bro what? the only people who’d be level 30, are from nz and australia. you shouldn’t be getting in lobbies with them.— Josh (@zabimqru) October 27, 2022.

Games Inbox: Is Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 worth getting?Since it’s not illegal to do this early access trick, it’s up to you whether you choose to try or not, though there are plenty of missions waiting for you in the campaign..

      "Modern Warfare 2 physical disc is almost empty with only 70MB of data | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 physical disc is almost empty with only 70MB of data. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – putting another nail in the coffin of physical media (pic: Activision)The physical version of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 barely contains anything at all, with the whole game still needing to be downloaded.. Downloading games instead of getting them on a disc long ago became the most popular way to buy video games, especially if it’s a primarily multiplayer game like Call Of Duty.. Publishers prefer this because you can’t sell digital copies second-hand and they don’t have to share any money with retailers, so it’s easy to see the fact that Modern Warfare 2’s game disc is almost empty as a way to encourage that further.. Fans that have got hold of an early copy of the game have discovered that there’s only 70MB of data on the disc. It’s unclear exactly how big the final game will be, but Modern Warfare 1 was famously the biggest game of all time with a file size of 175GB.. By the time it got further updates Modern Warfare was pushing 200GB, so at 70MB it’s likely there’s no actual game data on the disc at all, just the game licence to prove you own it.. As long as you pre-ordered, the campaign for Modern Warfare 2 has been free to play all week, leading up to the release of the multiplayer component this Friday, October 28.. There’s already been a 40GB update this week and there’ll be further downloads necessary once the multiplayer is available, making the disc almost completely useless.. Saturnalia review - getting away from it allYou can still resell it, since it proves you own the game, but it’s little more than a physical licence and means it’s completely impossible to play any element of the game without an internet connection.. This has only been confirmed for the PlayStation 5, but since digital downloads are even more popular on Xbox it’s highly unlikely the situation is any different there.. 70mb â¦ pic.twitter.com/NkgamI1VIs— Does it play?

      "Games Inbox: Getting a PS5 for Christmas, The Witcher remake doubts, and Rocksteady woes. The perfect Christmas present? (pic: Sony)The Thursday letters page asks which Bayonetta should be played first, as one reader is more positive about Modern Warfare 2’s campaign.. Witch one first?Really enjoyed reading your review of Bayonetta 3. I love the shear madness and inventiveness of it all which sounds very much up my street. Only issue is I’ve never played either of the other two games in the series.. I’m tempted to jump in with 3 but would you recommend played the originals first? They’re still £50 for the pair on the Switch store, so not exactly cheap!DuckOfDeath82. Horses for coursesI get confused when some reviews are great for something like Bayonetta 3 and others, like Eurogamer who described it as ‘a messy melange that just about retains PlatinumGames’ magic.’. And saying characters are a mess, as is the gameplay with top much going on at once, which I thought was part of the Bayonetta.TWO MACKS. Interactive cut scenesI’ve been enjoying the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 campaign. There’s been the occasional naff level like Amsterdam, which may as well have been a cut scene. I appreciate how the developer tries to break up the pacing from the shooting, I just feel they could make the gameplay more compelling in those segments, as opposed to living out a cut scene with basic interactions. But other than that, it’s great.. Visually speaking the game is stunning and easily the best looking Call Of Duty game to date. Arguably one of the most impressive of this generation. The character models in cut scenes are incredibly lifelike, but it’s the gun models in-game which have impressed me most. As far as first person shooters go, the gun models are easily the most realistic looking to date.. My favourite level so far is the Lone Soldier (Mark Wahlberg movie) inspired level. I won’t go into specifics, but as cool as that level was, I think they could have extended it even longer. There’s some decent variety to the campaign, and though it isn’t reinventing Call Of Duty, it’s an enjoyable ride.Anon. Now it really doesn’t affect the gameplay in A Plague Tale, it is slow paced, aiming is pretty much lock-on but I switched back and forth via quick resume between it and its prequel, that does run at 60fps, and it does change how the game feels. It is more responsive, small changes in the camera are better represented on screen and over corrections are less common..

      "Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer pre-load and system requirements for PC | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer pre-load and system requirements for PC. The clock is ticking! (pic: Activision)PC players around the world will soon be able to pre-load the full version of Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, a few hours ahead of its official launch.. The release of Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer is imminent – a week after some got early access to the campaign – and it’s bringing with it a bunch of new features, including new modes and a revamped Gunsmith system.. While PlayStation and Xbox players had the luxury of pre-loading the game a week early, PC players didn’t get the same treatment. Luckily, you don’t need to wait much longer, as the game’s pre-load process will unlock soon, giving you a day to prepare before it launches on Friday, October 28.. Before you go through with the hefty 72GB download, you might also need to clean out your game library and say goodbye to some golden oldies first.. When can you start pre-loading Modern Warfare 2 on PC?. If you’ve pre-ordered a digital copy of Modern Warfare 2 for PC you’ll be able to start pre-loading the game so that you’re ready to go the moment it launches.. Activision has confirmed that pre-loading for the game’s official launch, including multiplayer and Special Ops, will kick off on October 26 at 6pm BST. This date applies to you whether you purchased Modern Warfare 2 through Battle.net or Steam.. Only a few hours left before the game unlocks around the world (pic: Activision)If you’re a PC player, you should already have early access to the game’s campaign, as it unlocked on October 20 – only a day after it went live on PlayStation and Xbox.. What are the system requirements for Modern Warfare 2 on PC?. If you’ve already decked out your PC setup with the latest hardware, you should be able to enjoy Modern Warfare 2’s ultra-specs and play at a high frame rate and 4K resolution.. You also don’t need to worry if you’re still pushing through with an old setup, as you’ll still be able to run the game comfortably with minimum specs, without it looking too shabby.. The PC trailer exceeded fans’ expectations – but is it realistic? (pic: Activision)Judging from the campaign cut scenes and gameplay, the game looks very realistic, in part thanks to its high-tech facial motion capture, but whether you’ll be able to achieve that level of gameplay in multiplayer is an entirely different matter.. So, here are the official PC requirements for Modern Warfare 2, according to Activision:. Recommended/Competitive/Ultra 4K: Windows 10 64 Bit (Latest Update) // Windows 11 64 Bit (latest update).

The new era for Modern Warfare 2 is almost here! (pic: Activision)As Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s release date gets closer, one question still remains… is it worth the hype?. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer will go live in a few hours, bringing with it a variety of new features, such as new maps, game modes, and vehicles.. This year, Activision decided to switch things around and release the game’s campaign mode a week earlier, so that it doesn’t get ignored by those desperate to play the multiplayer. Not everyone’s happy with it though, as it features some gruesome missions, with popular political streamer HasanAbi joking the game is a ‘war crime simulator.’. Not much of Modern Warfare 2’s gameplay has been shown yet, leaving many fans wondering whether the reboot will be much different from previous versions – especially as its battle royale counterpart, Warzone 2.0, is also set to launch a month later.. When does Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer come out?. As Activision pulled a switcheroo with Modern Warfare 2’s release dates this year, you’re not to blame if you feel unsure about when each mode is out.. The game’s multiplayer, which is what everyone’s been waiting for, will officially launch on Friday, October 28, though you might need to wait a bit longer if you plan to play on PC.. PlayStation and Xbox have already had regional rollouts for the game’s campaign mode, and this will also be the case for the multiplayer..

According to Activision, regional rollouts should commence between 12pm to 5am from October 27-28 for consoles. If you live in the UK, you should expect the game to unlock… later rather than sooner.. As for PC players, the multiplayer’s release time is set in stone for 5am BST on October 28, for both Battle.net and Steam.. As always, you should take this information with a grain of salt, as other popular games, such as Overwatch 2, have suffered major launch problems recently.. How much does Modern Warfare 2 cost?. Like previous versions of the game, Modern Warfare 2’s standard edition costs £69.99 for both last and next gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles. The game’s physical copy for consoles costs £64.99.. If you’re a PC player, you’ll be able to save £10, as the standard edition is priced at £59.99, even though it comes with the exact same content.. There won’t be a Nintendo Switch or Google Stadia version of Modern Warfare 2, especially since the latter is in the process of shutting down for good.. Is there a special edition of Modern Warfare 2?. There isn’t a physical special edition for Modern Warfare 2 but there is a Vault Edition available online for all platforms.. The Vault Edition is priced at £99.99 (£30 more than the standard edition) for last and next gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles.. Once again, if you play the game on PC, you’ll be able to save £15 and buy the Vault Edition for £84.99.. Here are all the extras the Modern Warfare 2 Vault Edition offers:. Ghost Legacy pack for Modern Warfare and Warzone. The Vault Edition also comes with campaign early access, the Final Judgement bundle, the Khaled Al-Asad Operator bundle, and the Oni Operator pack, from the standard edition.. The Red Team 141 Operator pack looks pretty sick (pic: Activision)If you’ve already bought the standard edition, but wish you’d gone for the Vault, you can upgrade for an extra £25 through Steam.. What’s new in Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer?. Modern Warfare 2 has promised to bring several new improvements and changes to the series’ gameplay, ranging from advanced AI systems in the campaign and co-op modes to enhanced water physics and swimming mechanics.. You can style your weapons however you want (pic: Activision)In a bid to shake up the perks system, Modern Warfare 2 will introduce Perk Packages, which are equipped as part of a multiplayer loadout. Each package consists of four perks: two base perks plus one bonus perk and one ultimate perk.. DDoS attacks can cause a lot of damage both in-game and IRL (pic: Activision)All the Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer modes. The game’s multiplayer will offer two distinct mode categories at launch, based on the type of map they are played on: core map modes and battle map modes.. However, this time you’ll be able to play two completely new core map modes: Knock Out and Prisoner Rescue. Knock Out will see two teams attempt to capture a bag full of cash from the middle of the map, while unable to respawn one another.. Here are all the core and battle map modes available at launch, as well as other modes set to hit the game later on:. Resident Evil Re:Verse review – a multiplayer biohazard. With all these new modes coming to Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer, many hoped that a Zombies mode will also be included.. Some dataminers managed to find some zombie-related files though, which may indicate they’re coming later as DLC.. While you’re waiting for Modern Warfare 2’s launch to start, why not give its campaign mode a try and see if you can find secret weapons that are locked away in safes in the El Sin Nombre and Alone missions?.

      "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – have you played it? (pic: Activision)The Wednesday letters page considers the strange case of Metal Gear Solid’s English translation, as one reader bets on Elden Ring for GOTY.. Interpret vs. translateI have to disagree with Ghostcaller and his suggestion a Metal Gar Solid movie wouldn’t work without Kojima. In my opinion, the best dialogue in any Metal Gear Solid game is the original PlayStation one and that’s down to the American translator, Jeremy Blaustein.. There is a great article about it on Polygon and ever since reading it it’s helped me understand why the hell it’s so hard to follow what’s going on in all the subsequent Metal Gear Solid games.TommyFatFingers.

It did seem to be Elden Ring’s main rival but I’m sensing that it’s no groundbreaker, based on the previews.. Despite only having played Elden Ring I still think it’s going to walk away with the majority of awards, including from GC. God Of War, I think, will just be seen more of the same, and could even mess up its ending. Bayonetta 3 I admittedly know nothing about, but the pacing issues seemed a problem it is also a sequel that is obviously similar to what came before.. You could argue that Elden Ring is just Dark Souls 4 with a different name, and I do agree it’s a shame how every big game is basically a sequel, but at least Elden Ring is technically something new.

To be exact, there are three safes to locate in the El Sin Nombre and Alone missions, and if you manage to open all of them you’ll also get the Gentleman Thief achievement to prove your skill.. Where is the safe in the El Sin Nombre mission?. Rewards: Plate Carrier armour and Lockwood 300 shotgun. When playing the El Sin Nombre mission you can find one safe tucked away at Diego’s apartment. In order to find it, you have to wait until Alejandro hands you a knife and mask, after you exit the lift.. You can kill the guard by throwing a knife at him, so you don’t alarm anyone else in the building, and then you’ll be free to break into Diego’s apartment and locate his safe. Just be quick, as you don’t want to risk another guard spotting you.. Assuming that all goes well, you should find yourself looking at the cupboard to the right of Diego’s bed to reveal the first safe. Input the code ’02-02-19′ to open it and inside you’ll find a Plate Carrier armour and a silenced Lockwood 300 shotgun.. Every #MW2 Safe Code and Location to unlock exclusive content for the campaign: – El Sin Nombre safe code: 02-02-19– Alone safe code 1: 10-10-80 – Alone safe code 2: 37-60-80 pic.twitter.com/hd3vmi7SB8— CoD: Warzone & Vanguard Source (@BlackOpsLeaks) October 24, 2022. Where are the two safes in the Alone mission?. Rewards: Throwing knife and silenced .50 GS pistol. Unlike the El Sin Nombre mission, the Alone mission holds two safes hidden away in some inconspicuous spots.. The first safe is in a locked office inside the coffee shop, though you need to be careful as there are some traps laid down for you. You’ll know you’re close when you see a shotgun trap at the bottom of a flight of stairs.. You’ll need to deactivate the trap and get hold of the shotgun, and then you’ll be free to go up the stairs and find a door waiting for you at the end of the corridor.. The safe is to the right of the desk, and the combo to unlock it is ’10-10-80′. Inside it, you’ll find a throwing knife and the silenced .50 GS pistol, which can prove very handy in stealth missions.. Rewards: Crossbow and throwing knife. You can get the last safe in Modern Warfare 2, straight after you unlock the one located in the coffee shop.. Once you’re in, go to the back of this workshop and enter the office by the water cooler. The safe will be in the corner of the room, opposite the door that leads outside.. Input the code ‘37-60-80’ to unlock it, and inside you’ll find a crossbow and a throwing knife, though the first one comes with only two bolts.. Assuming that you’ve already unlocked the other two safes, you’ll also receive the Gentleman Thief Trophy or Achievement.. There are also plenty of other high-tier rewards you can get by completing Modern Warfare 2’s campaign, while you get familiar with the newest version of the game..

      "Modern Warfare 2 campaign is a 'war crime simulator' says HasanAbi | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 campaign is a ‘war crime simulator’ says HasanAbi. There were some intense moments in MW2’s campaign (pic: Metro.co.uk)Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s campaign mode went live a few days ago and Twitch streamer HasanAbi wasn’t impressed.. Although Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 isn’t officially out until this Friday, if you pre-ordered the game you can already play the single-player campaign.. HasanAbi usually promotes anti-war and anti-imperialism views on his streams but he seemed to think Modern Warfare 2’s campaign was funny, as he jokingly called the game a ‘war crime simulator.’. If you’ve not had the chance to play Modern Warfare’s 2 campaign yet, beware as there will be some mild spoilers.. One mission stood out to HasanAbi in particular, in which he and Task Force 141 were called to drop into a desert area, accompanied by a friendly helicopter.. Those watching immediately recognised that the mission was inspired by the real-life raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan. Which is unsurprising as Call Of Duty often mirrors scenes from news headlines.. HasanAbi dismissed the comments and said: ‘If that were the case, the helicopter in front of me would immediately explode. Everybody knows that Seal Team Six loves dropping helicopters. It’s famously their most favourite thing to do.’. ‘Okay, this game is realistic,’ HasanAbi said while unable to control his laughter.. finishing war crime simulator later, been an insane journey, def learned a lot pic.twitter.com/poAPv9dh6V— hasanabi (@hasanthehun) October 24, 2022. HasanAbi didn’t immediately understand his role in that mission, but once he realised that he had to assassinate the politician he initially tried to resist.. Modern Warfare 2 is biggest Call Of Duty launch ever for PlayStation. Modern Warfare 2 menu and UI the ‘absolute worst’ according to its own players. Games Inbox: Is Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 worth getting?HasanAbi huffed and puffed through a few of the missions in his stream but doesn’t seem to have completed the campaign so far.. He’s usually famous for roasting controversial celebrities and political figures on his Twitch channel, and rarely plays that many games nowadays. But it is odd to see him laughing at something that would legitimately be regarded as illegal in real-life.. Not all of his viewers saw the funny side though, with Zaed Qureshi saying: ‘I hope one day Call Of Duty can be a based series that critiques the military industrial complex, but until then, it continues to be cringe.’.

      "Modern Warfare 2 DLC includes zombies according to deleted datamine | Metro News. Modern Warfare 2 DLC includes zombies according to deleted datamine. This marks the first time zombies have appeared in a Modern Warfare title (pic: Activision)Activision has taken down images claiming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is getting a zombies mode.. Zombies have long been an iconic part of the Call Of Duty series but not necessarily the Modern Warfare sub-series. For the most part Zombies mode has been relegated to the Treyarch developed titles, such as the Black Ops sub-series, although they have appeared in others as well.. Treyarch made a Zombies mode for Sledgehammer Games’ Call Of Duty: Vanguard, for example, and Infinity Ward had them in Infinite Warfare. However, they’ve never appeared in any Modern Warfare title.. This was apparently to keep the Modern Warfare games feeling more realistic (that was the case for the 2019 game at least), but it’s looking like that won’t be the case for the upcoming Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.. Nothing’s been confirmed by Activision or developer Infinity Ward yet but, over the weekend, someone was able to find evidence of a Zombies mode in the game’s files, via datamining.. It’s not clear exactly how they found this evidence, but it’s most likely thanks to Modern Warfare 2’s campaign mode, since it’s available in early access for those who pre-ordered the game.. Twitter user CODSploitzImgz shared a few images without context, and they have since been deleted due to a ‘report from the copyright holder.’ As is always the case with these situations, Activision’s efforts to contain the leak have only acted to confirm it’s real.. One of the images can be found on Reddit courtesy of user Chicken769, showing a selection of game modes. One of them, with a skull logo, is clearly marked as ‘round-based zombies,’ with another titled ‘Outbreak’ right next to it.. Outbreak is a zombie mode introduced in Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, so it stands to reason that it, or a different take on it, is coming back for Modern Warfare 2 in the future..

Please enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy noticeSaying goodbye to Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor feels bittersweet. As the first female actor to play the Time Lord, she’s brought Doctor Who up to speed with modern times – but her tenure has often struggled to live up to its potential. That’s due less to her performance – lord knows, she’s been giving all she can – than the scripts the actor has been given. There’s been a renewed interest in the show with Russell T Davies, the brains behind the original reboot, taking back the showrunner reins for the next series.We know that Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa will be the 14th Doctor – a choice that was warmly received by fans. But rather than speculating about its future, I want this last review to focus on Whittaker. And, given the final moments of Whittaker’s regeneration were removed from the episode sent to reviewers, the Doctor’s latest guise remains a mystery for now anyway. (Update: it’s David Tennant.) On paper, Whittaker’s last episode, entitled “The Power of the Doctor”, sounds as thrilling as it gets. The Master (Sacha Dhawan), plus Cybermen AND Daleks? It’s a bad guy bonanza! Realising that hatred of the Doctor might be the only thing to unite her metallic foes, the villainous Time Lord has hatched a plan to destroy the human race (obvs). Unfortunately, as has consistently been the problem, the action feels unnecessarily opaque, and bounds across time and space like the confusing miniseries “Flux” did.In this episode, it’s Dhawan, not Whittaker, who gets to do the fun stuff. The Master disguises himself as Rasputin (yes, we get a Boney M dance break), then forces the Doctor to regenerate with him and swap bodies, Freaky Friday style. The Doctor, meanwhile, is running around trying to save the world, acutely aware that her time is running out. But the adventure plot and her looming regeneration feel disconnected, with Whittaker given little space to interweave that fear and emotion into the action unfolding around her.Other friends and foes from Whittaker’s stint swing by to bid farewell. To mark the BBC centenary, the special also pays tribute to the show’s legacy as a whole. We get the welcome return of Eighties companions Tegan (Janet Fielding) and Ace (Sophie Aldred), who’ve been enlisted by Unit to help save the planet. Satisfyingly, it’s Fielding who gets the best line of the episode, as Tegan tells Ace, “I was an air hostess in the early Eighties. Trust me, compared to that, a building full of Cybermen is nothing.” But with its 90-minute run time, there’s room for further nods to old Who too. As Whittaker prepares to die, she’s greeted by not one, but five previous Doctors, their faces shifting and morphing into each other like a distorted Comic Con line-up.RecommendedGangs of London season two review: the blistering, balletic mob action-drama is back Somewhere Boy review: A charming paean to the indomitable human spirit, anchored by a star-making turnThe Elon Musk Show review: The central flaw of this BBC series? The SpaceX founder isn’t interestingAmong the nostalgia and Easter eggs, the relationship between the Doctor and Yaz – the thing I expected this episode to really be about – is sidelined. When their hands lightly touch at the end of the episode, the camera doesn’t linger as it has in the past. It’s frustrating, but also throws off the power dynamics. The Doctor has to be stoic, but watching her comfort a teary-eyed Yaz when she’s the one about to regenerate implies the relationship was more one-sided than we’ve been baited to believe.Still, Whittaker’s exit (or what I’ve seen of it) is predictably powerful. Initially, it’s very Tennant, the Doctor crying out that she “wants more time”. But eventually she finds peace in regeneration, spending her last moments atop the Tardis with Yaz, looking over the Earth with a smile on her face. “I have loved being with you Yaz,” she tells her friend. “And I have loved being me.” It’s a positive send-off to the Whittaker era. And, in some ways, I feel the same. I loved Whittaker being the Doctor; I just wish I could have loved being with her a bit more, too.\n",

There are no depths of bad taste The Crown does not plumb: Netflix series portrays Charles, Philip and The Queen with disdain bordering on mockery while William is seen as slightly dim and sulky and Harry is let off lightly, writes CHRISTOPHER STEVENS.

Prince William 'will take an active role in planning King Charles III's coronation': Prince of Wales 'will help set tone for May 6 ceremony to make sure it is less ''imperial'' and ''archaic'' and reflects modern Britain'Prince William is expected to take an 'active role' in his father's coronation and help set the tone for the eventHe is said to be particularly keen on ensuring the May 2023 coronation reflects modern BritainIt will be the first time an heir has held a formal role in the planning stages in three generationsDiscussions are underway as to how the royal palace can modernise and shorten the eventBy Brittany Chain For Mailonline and Inderdeep Bains Deputy Chief Reporter For Daily Mail. Prince William is expected to take an 'active role' in his father's coronation and help set the tone for the scaled-back event.He is said to be particularly keen on ensuring the May 2023 coronation reflects modern Britain by avoiding any 'archaic, feudal or imperial' elements. His inclusion in the planning process will be welcomed as a sign of continuity between King Charles III and his heir to the throne, and will mark the first time an heir has played an active role in a coronation in three generations.Charles was just four when his mother was crowned and the late Queen was 11 at the time of her father's coronation. As such, neither played a formal role in proceedings.The Prince of Wales is likely to hold an active advisory position in addition to taking part in the coronation itself, The Telegraph reported.Discussions are underway as to how the royal palace can modernise and shorten the event while also ensuring it captures the significance of the occasion.. Prince William is expected to take an 'active role' in his father's coronation and help set the tone for the scaled-back event. Prince William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales, are both expected to have a role in the coronationThere are hopes Prince William will bring a fresh perspective to discussions and will instinctively reflect his own generation. Buckingham Palace is yet to confirm who will partake in the coronation committee.While plans for 'Operation Golden Orb' have been in the works for years, royal sources have previously said officials had never seriously considered the ins and outs of the event to ensure it would best reflect the 'climate at the time in which it happens'.The coronation, which will see the eyes of the world once more turn onto the Britain, is set to take place on a Saturday - scuppering the hopes of many who might have wished for a bank holiday to mark the occasion, as insiders claim it is 'unlikely' extra time off will be given.  It will also take place on the fourth birthday of Harry and Meghan's son, Archie, potentially causing a clash in the Sussex household if the King's second son is invited to the ceremony as is expected.It's not clear what - if any - role the Sussexes will play in the coronation.. His inclusion in the planning process will be welcomed as a sign of continuity between King Charles and his heir to the throne, and will mark the first time an heir has played an active role in a coronation in three generations. As the new king, Charles will be front and centre of the new-look monarchy. The biggest change will be his residence. He will likely move to Buckingham Palace. Pictured: King Charles at Dumfries House, Scotland Charles 'right' not to go big. By Michael Hamilton and Robin PerrieTwo choristers who sang at the Queen's coronation say King Charles is right to scale back on the 'splendour and magic' for his crowning.Around 8,000 guests were invited to Elizabeth's event in 1953, while her son is set to have 2,000 on May 6 next year.And ceremonial robes are set to be ditched in favour of lounge suits.Adrian Dence, 82, and Stanley Roocroft, 84, were schoolboy choristerss at Westminster Abbey in '53. Retired food salesman Adrian, of Milford on Sea, Hants, said: 'I think they are right to have a toned-down event and not try to match the splendour of the Queen's coronation.'Stanley, of Hawes, West Yorks, was 'incredibly moved' by the Queen's passing. He said of her funeral: 'We do those events so well - the pomp and pageantry was something to behold.' Advertisement. King Charles, 73, is said to want a more modest affair than is tradition with the event being cut down to less than an hour, the guest list slashed by a three quarters and a less formal dress code.'The Coronation will reflect the monarch's role today and look towards the future, while being rooted in longstanding traditions and pageantry,' the Palace confirmed last month.The announcement comes amid mounting speculation the momentous occasion is being slimmed down due to the cost of living crisis and to make way for a more streamlined, modern monarchy.Palace insiders said that while the Coronation will include the same core elements of the traditional ceremony which has retained a similar structure for more than 1,000 years, it would recognise the 'spirit of our times'.It is expected to be much 'smaller and simpler' than the three-hour spectacle of the late Queen's momentous Coronation in 1953.The guestlist could also be slashed from 8,000 to just 2,000 with a more relaxed dress code. Peers may possibly be allowed to wear lounge suits rather than ceremonial robes.Ancient and time-consuming rituals - including presenting the monarch with gold ingots - are also set to be axed to save time.Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams says the date itself will have been chosen after consultation with 'the Government, the Church of England and the Royal Household'. Palace insiders have assured while the event will be smaller than the Queen's coronation, it will not be devoid of pageantry.. King Charles 'WON'T progress with plans for slimmed-down.... Sources told the Daily Express Kate and William will may have to increase their workload and take on new jobs What was Queen Elizabeth II's coronation like? When Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953 there was a carnival of celebration as millions rejoiced in the display which provided a morale boost to a nation on its knees after the war.For a day, street parties banished the hardship of post-war rationing and shortages, and even atrocious, unseasonal weather could not dampen the enthusiasm.People began to bed down in the streets of London as early as 48 hours before Tuesday June 2 1953, just to make sure they had a standing place to watch the Queen pass by.By Monday evening, in pouring rain and driving wind, half a million people were already lining the procession route.The public were not the only ones making preparations.In a tribute, Charles - now King - paid to his mother on her 80th birthday, he recalled the night before the big day when he was four years old.'I have vivid memories of the coronation; of my mother coming to say goodnight to my sister and me while wearing the crown so that she could get used to its weight on her head before the coronation ceremony; of thousands of people gathered in The Mall outside Buckingham Palace chanting 'We want the Queen' and keeping me awake at night,' he said.Despite initial reservations, the Queen eventually agreed to the TV cameras being present in Westminster Abbey to capture the event.Licence holders doubled from one and a half million to three million in anticipation and many people rented a set for the day.An estimated 27 million people in Britain alone watched the coronation live on their black and white televisions and the images were beamed around the world.At Buckingham Palace after the ceremony, the Queen, wearing her crown, and Philip appeared on the balcony with the other members of the royal family.Their children, Charles and Anne, were greeted with great excitement by the crowds.In her broadcast address to the nation the same evening, the young Queen thanked the public for their support.All of you, near or far, have been united in one purpose. It is hard for me to find words in which to tell you of the strength which this knowledge has given me,' she said.She added: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine.'Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.'The night came to an end as hundreds of thousands on Victoria Embankment watched a spectacular coronation fireworks display. Advertisement. King Charles 'WON'T progress with plans for slimmed-down monarchy and will keep number of working royals at 11'By Tom Scotson for MailOnline King Charles III said he will not progress with plans for a slimmed-down monarchy and will keep the number of working royals at 11, sources claim.His Majesty's decision is more 'conservative' than critics and pundits have speculated after the monarch was expected to streamline the list of working royals. The 73-year-old King will also pay tax like his late mother, after in 1993 she ripped up George VI's tax break agreed by Neville Chamberlin.. King Charles III said he will not progress with plans for a slimmed-down monarchy and will keep the number of working royals at 11. The news comes after the Palace said it wanted a cut-down Coronation which will have fewer arcane rituals and be significantly shorter than the 1953 ceremony when Queen Elizabeth was crowned.Data shows the former Prince of Wales paid £5.8million in income tax after receiving £23million from the Duchy of Cornwall estate in 2021. Close advisors believe with fewer generations of working royals the family will have to cut back on their 3,500 annual engagements. Aides are discussing what will happen to charities which attract thousands of pounds through royal representation and visits. One senior royal source told the Daily Express: 'These are things that are all being looked at as part of a wider review at the moment.'Sources told the paper Kate and William may have to increase their workload and take on new jobs.  But Kate has made it clear that she would prefer to look after her own children than expand the family's portfolio. The departure of Harry and Megan and Prince Andrew has put more strains on the group's ability to meet all of its commitments. Senior royals can be defined as members of the family close to the line of the succession who represent the Crown on special visits. For years reports were made that King Charles III wanted a 'slimmed down' monarchy which would cut down the number of working royals from eleven to 7.  Experts suggested this would make his operation a 'leaner machine' with 'less to gossip about'. There would also be 'no hangers-on' in the Firm, with each member expected to pull their weight in a new and more streamlined monarchy.. Harry and Meghan (pictured) leaving has raised issues and Prince Andrew leaving made matters more tricky.. One senior royal source told the Daily Express: 'These are things that are all being looked at as part of a wider review at the moment'But King Charles' original model, which reportedly involved a tight core of just seven people, including himself, has been thrown into doubt following a series of external events. The plan, put in motion before the Queen's death, originally included the long-reigning monarch along with Prince Philip, King Charles and Camilla, Prince William and Kate and Prince Harry.Philip died aged 99 in 2021, while Harry's future in the slimmed-down monarchy seems hugely doubtful following his decision to quit front line royal duties and move to America with his wife Meghan Markle.Meanwhile, Prince Andrew, who would likely have featured in a slimmed-down monarchy as a son of the Queen and King Charles' brother, has been outcast since his US sex assault lawsuit with Virginia Giuffre.But that has pushed Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, and Prince Edward and his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex, into the fray as 'key' parts of King Charles' future monarchy, according to royal watchers.Royal experts always expected Princess Anne - who has always been one of the most popular royal figures according to polling - to play an important role in Charles's plans. Edward and Sophie, Earl and Countess of Wessex took a significant chunk of work when Harry and Megan departed the royal family and may continue to play a central role. They were more prominent than almost any other member of the Royal family in the days leading up to Prince Philip's funeral in 2021.. It is believed King Charles will follow in his mother's footsteps and move into Buckingham Palace as king. One royal source told the Mail on Sunday in February: 'There is no question about it. HRH's view is that you need a monarch at monarchy HQ. This has never been in doubt.'. Prince William takes ‘active role’ in planning King Charles’s coronation. Prince William 'will take an active role in planning King Charles III's coronation'\n",

Read our privacy noticeUnions representing tens of millions of workers in India are calling on Britain to suspend talks on a trade deal with the country, warning it would open UK markets to goods produced by child labour and modern slavery.A deal with the south Asian giant is one of the most coveted goals of Britain’s post-Brexit trade policy, after hopes of a similar agreement with the US came to nothing. But Indian unions have claimed working conditions within the country could deteriorate further as a result of any deal, with Britain’s Trades Union Congress (TUC) raising concerns over the “widespread” use of forced labour. India’s 2011 census puts the number of child labourers in the country at 10.1 million, with 5.6 million boys and 4.5 million girls.“Low pay and exploitative conditions are widespread in India, with forced and child labour found in a number of industries including textiles, silk, brick manufacturing, shipbreaking, embroidery, hospitality and tobacco,” the unions said in a joint statement with the TUC. RecommendedBoris Johnson forced out in scandal but could run to replace Liz Truss as PMHow world leaders reacted to Liz Truss’s resignationCandidates to replace Liz Truss will need support of 100 MPs to join Tory race“Instead of paving a new path of development, it may further deteriorate the condition of workers in India,” Shoya Yoshida, of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), added. “Respecting trade union and human rights should be a prerequisite in signing trade agreements.”Unions representing 47m workers in the country are now urging the UK to suspend negotiations with Narendra Modi’s government until it respects basic international labour standards.Liz Truss had said she wanted to conclude the talks in time for Diwali next week but that has been thrown into question after she announced her resignation on Thursday. It is the latest in a series of blows for the prospective deal after the former home secretary Suella Braverman said liberalising visas for Indian travellers to the UK was “not what people voted for with Brexit” and could drive illegal immigration.Calls have been made to suspend talks with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s government. (AP)Her comments incensed the Indian side, with the country’s ministers reportedly left “shocked and disappointed”.Signatories urging a halt to talks include the country's largest trade union confederation, the Indian National Trade Union Congress – and other unions representing workers across virtually every sector of the economy.“In 2020 India adopted labour laws that severely limit the right to strike and workers’ right to collectively bargain with employers,” the union statement said. “India has not ratified all the fundamental International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, including those on freedom of association, collective bargaining and health and safety at work. “In November 2020 the Indian government violently suppressed strikes to protest against these labour laws and passing agricultural reforms that would threaten the livelihoods of millions of farmers. “Furthermore, anti-terrorist laws, such as the Unlawful Practices Prevention Act, are being used to imprison thousands of trade unionists.”Suella Braverman upset Indian negotiators by expressing concern the deal could drive illegal immigration (Getty)The unions come from different corners of India’s vast and powerful organised labour movement and include federations with millions of members, such as the HMS, CFTUI and SEWA.They say they are worried the agreement could displace workers in good jobs by undermining the country’s domestic industries, while British unions have also warned it could make it easier for companies to send Indian workers to the UK without complying with agreements over pay and conditions. There are also fears that India removing tariffs on agriculture could undermine its ability to produce its own food.The organisations say no agreement should be agreed until India signs up to fundamental UN International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions on workers’ rights.Shoya Yoshida, of the ITUC-AP, told The Independent: “When the government of India is not showing any respect for core labour standards in the current situation, including the right to organise and collectively bargain, the India-UK trade deal will not serve its purpose of genuinely bringing prosperity to the people of its countries.”Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the UK should be “using its leverage on the global stage to promote decent work” and urged ministers to “listen to trade unions in both the UK and India and act to stop serious rights abuses”.“A UK-India trade deal could encourage companies to outsource more jobs from the UK to India, leading to a race to the bottom,” she said. “And such a deal could deepen gender inequalities and threaten food security in India by encouraging cheap imports.”TUC head Frances O’Grady questioned the deal’s potential impact on workers’ rights. (PA)The US government’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs states that “children in India are subjected to the worst forms of child labour”, with children performing “dangerous tasks in garment production, stone quarrying, and brickmaking”. Meanwhile, NGO Amnesty International notes that the Indian government has cracked down on NGOs campaigning against child labour without giving reasons.India’s ministry of labour and employment says that “the problem of child labour continues to pose a challenge” but that the government “has been taking various proactive measures to tackle this problem”.It however notes that “considering the magnitude and extent of the problem and that it is essentially a socio-economic problem inextricably linked to poverty and illiteracy, it requires concerted efforts from all sections of the society” to solve.RecommendedJemma Mitchell: Therapist who murdered friend becomes first woman in UK to be sentenced on televisionSuspension bridge collapse kills at least 133 in IndiaAt least 32 dead, many injured after India bridge collapseA spokesperson at the UK’s Department for International Trade said the government did not comment on live trade negotiations but added: “We maintain a high level of protection of our labour standards and will not compromise them in any of our trade agreements.“The UK continues to advocate for the highest labour standards and working conditions globally, including working to eradicate modern slavery in global supply chains.”. 1/4India trade deal ‘would open UK to goods produced by child labour’.

It was simply redefined’: Why ending slavery is on the ballot in five statesAbolitionists are backing changes to state constitutions that could end forced prison labour, the 13th Amendment “loophole” keeping American slavery alive. Alex Woodward reports Friday 21 October 2022 15:41. Please enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy noticeCurtis Davis spent nearly 26 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary, the site of a former plantation fueled by slave labour that is now among the largest maximum security prisons in the country.He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole after he was convicted of second-degree murder. He was released from the prison, known as Angola, in 2016, after accepting a plea deal that reduced his charge to manslaughter.While imprisoned, he worked at a quail barn for 20 years “all at the point of a gun,” Mr Davis said in a briefing over Zoom with reporters earlier this month.More than 150 years after slavery’s formal end in the US, voters in five states will decide whether to close a devastating loophole that has effectively kept slavery in action: It allows prisons to send people convicted of certain crimes into forced labour.“The Louisiana criminal justice system has used [its] legal apparatus as a weapon against mostly marginalized communities,” Mr Davis said. “We have returned back into a condition of slavery or involuntary servitude.”RecommendedThe future of abortion care is on the ballot in these five statesIncarcerated workers in Louisiana prisons earn as little as 2 cents an hour, according to a report from the American Civil Liberties Union and the University of Chicago Law School Global Human Rights Clinic.But every incarcerated person at Angola, a vast majority of whom are Black, begins their work in the fields, where enslaved people worked hundreds of acres of crops before the property began functioning as a prison in 1880.Field labourers, supervised by correction officers on horseback, have few chances of promotion to other work, with virtually no access to water, rest or restrooms.It’s a lucrative business. A poultry processing plant relied on incarcerated workers to avoid shutting down during the Covid-19 pandemic. A commodities trader bought nearly $2.5m worth of corn and soybeans from the state’s prison industry between 2017 and 2020. Livestock auction companies purchased at least $5m in livestock raised by prison labourers within that same time period.RecommendedDonald Trump helped release drug prisoners. Now he wants to execute themThe exploitation of incarcerated workers is legally allowed through the exception clause of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, which formally abolished slavery in the US in the aftermath of the Civil War.While the 13th Amendment prohibits the enslavement of Americans, it exempts slavery as punishment for those convicted of a crime. An era of “Black codes” in economically devastated southern states in the war’s aftermath subjected harsh penalties against newly freed Americans for crimes like loitering or breaking curfew, ensuring they would remain in chains for decades to follow.That exception remains in 20 states, allowing incarcerated workers “to be exploited, underpaid, and excluded from workplace safety protection laws,” according to the ACLU and Global Human Rights Clinic.Today, roughly 800,000 of the more than 1.2 million people incarcerated in state and federal prisons are forced to work, generating roughly $11bn annually.The entrance to Louisiana State Penitentiary, known as Angola, is pictured in 2008. (AP)In 2018, Colorado voters were the first to remove such language from their state’s constitution through a ballot measure. Voters in Nebraska and Utah did the same two years later.This year, voters in Louisiana, as well as Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont will decide if their state constitutions will finally remove similar language.The #EndtheException coalition, spanning dozens of state and local organisations, is leading a campaign to support their passage.Mr Davis told reporters that the passage of the amendments would be the “crown jewel” of criminal justice reform, a key moment in an abolitionist movement that seeks to reshape the nation’s vast network of prison labour.“Take it from a man who served 25 years, nine months, and 11 days as an involuntary servant,” Mr Davis said. “If you guys don’t believe that this changes anything, it’s only because you’ve never went through the condition of slavery.”RecommendedHow Biden’s marijuana pardons could change thousands of livesVermont has prided itself as the first state in the nation to outlaw slavery, beginning in 1777, predating the Emancipation Proclamation, ratification of the 13th Amendment and the US Constitution itself.But the state constitution has retained an involuntary servitude clause in certain cases, including as restitution for debt, damages and fines.“We believe that at the end of the day when it comes on 8 November in Vermont that we will have accomplished something that has not been accomplished in 245 years in his state,” said Rev Mark Hughes, executive director of Justice For All and Abolish Slavery Vermont, in the aforementioned briefing.The language on the Tennessee measure explicitly states that “slavery and involuntary servitude are forever prohibited” and that “nothing in this section shall prohibit an inmate from working when the inmate has been duly convicted of a crime.”Tennessee “like the rest of the South made a seamless transition from plantations to prisons,” Theeda Murphy, lead organiser of Tennessee’s No Exceptions Prisons Collective said in the briefing.A fence is pictured outside Elmore Correctional Facility in Alabama. Incarcerated people in the state alleged forced starvation and labour during a recent three-week strike. (AP)“We have never been free. Slavery was never abolished, it was simply redefined,” she continued. “It’s way past time for universal abolition. As long as we make excuses for why it’s OK for human beings to be owned and treated like property, none of our dreams of a just and equitable society can be realised.”Over the course of a three-week strike at correctional facilities across Alabama, likely the largest collective action and strike among incarcerated people in the state’s history, people imprisoned in the state alleged retaliation from officers in the form of starvation, solitary confinement and forced labour.The state’s Department of Corrections announced on 17 October that the protests and work stoppages “have ended,” but a statement from organisers said the end of the latest campaign is “by no means a white flag,” and that incarcerated people may “escalate our strike, peacefully,” until demands are heard.“We are still demanding our concerns be heard before our Legislators and other elected officials,” the group said in a statement. “We also demand that our outside representatives be given a platform to be our voice and the public hear our arguments.”Voters in Alabama will determine whether to strike out all racist language from the state’s constitution, including a section on prison labour similar to the Tennessee measure.“We know what it looks like,” said Savannah Eldridge, a lead organiser with the Abolish Slavery National Network, in the briefing. “It looks like working in the heat of the day and triple digit temperatures and Texas prisons with no air conditioning, or the rationing of food or other basic necessities in response to peaceful demonstrations, as in Alabama. What’s not arguable is that forced labor continues today.”RecommendedLouisiana begins moving child inmates to notorious Angola prison’s former death row unitSimilar referendums have passed with wide margins elsewhere in previous years. The measure in Nebraska passed with 68 per cent of the vote. Utah’s passed with 80 per cent in support. Yet, after the referendum in Colorado where 66 per cent of voters supported an amendment to remove the loophole, a judge dismissed a lawsuit that pressed for higher wages for prison workers.Another lawsuit seeking to end the practise of compulsory prison labour is playing out in states courts, where attorneys for the state have asked that the case be dismissed.Inmates Richard Lilgerose and Harold Mortis sued Colorado’s Democratic Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado Department of Corrections, arguing that the state continues to force people into work in conditions that amount to involuntary servitude.RecommendedPrisoners in Alabama keep dying as inmates go on statewide labour strikeThe ballot measure in Louisiana is so far the only one that has drawn any recognisable opposition.One of the original sponsors of the bill that drafted the referendum, Democratic state Rep Edmond Jordan, told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate that he wants voters to reject it. Critics have warned that the measure could have “unintended consequences” and end up doing the opposite of what sets out to do. They’ve called on state lawmakers to rewrite the proposal’s language and reintroduce the measure at another time.The state’s constitution currently states that “slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited, except in the latter case as punishment for a crime.” The amendment would change that language to “slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited, (but this) does not apply to the otherwise lawful administration of criminal justice.”“This amendment is an example of why it is so important to get the language right when presenting constitutional amendments to voters,” according to public policy nonprofit group Council for a Better Louisiana, which is urging voters to vote against it.RecommendedSupreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pummels Alabama attorneys over ‘race blindness’ in major voting rights caseMr Davis has called such arguments “disingenuous at best and intellectually dishonest at worse.”“The clear legislative intent of this initiative is to remove slavery and involuntary servitude from the constitution,” he said. “Our opponents of our initiative have orchestrated a confusion campaign to mislead voters about the meaning of the bill.”Mr Davis said opposition to the amendment has suggested that an activist judge could sentence people to slavery and “say that that’s actual lawful activity of the criminal justice system,” but that disregards wording in the bill that probits slavery.“If slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited, period, than the otherwise lawful activity of the criminal justice system would be something other than the two outlawed parts of our amendment,” he said..

Former PM takes early lead with Rishi Sunak in second as a quarter of Tory MPs declare their support in race to replace Liz Truss - candidates need at least 100 backers by MONDAY as battle 'for soul of the party' intensifiesLiz Truss has dramatically resigned as PM after a flood of no-confidence calls from Conservative MPs Just 44 days after taking the keys to No10 Ms Truss declared that a replacement will be chosen within a week Mini-Budget fallout caused chaos and the situation has spiralled out of control over the past few days  Utter chaos was seen in the House of Commons division lobbies last night as Tories rowed over crunch vote Suella Braverman quit as Home Secretary admitting protocol breach by sending email on immigration policy Ms Truss has told the Commons yesterday: 'I am a fighter not a quitter' as she faced Starmer in a fierce PMQsBy David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor and James Tapsfield, Political Editor and Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent and Laurence Dollimore For Mailonline and Harriet Line Deputy Political Editor For The Daily Mail. Boris Johnson is currently the most popular choice among Tory MPs to become prime minister as the race to replace Liz Truss roared into life today following her humiliating resignation after just 44 days in power. With a quarter of MPs declaring support for their preferred candidates, Mr Johnson currently counts 38 backers, compared to Rishi Sunak's 27 and Penny Mourdant's 12, according to the latest tally by Guido Fawkes. It comes after the Conservative Party announced would-be successors would need to win nominations from 100 MPs to get on the ballot. The threshold means that realistically a maximum of three can make it into a vote, and that there could be a simple coronation of a winner if they get far more than that.. The former chancellor was in his constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire - some 250 miles away from Westminster - when Miss Truss resigned.He faced accusations of backstabbing Mr Johnson after his resignation from Cabinet triggered the former PM's downfall.Mr Sunak is expected to be among several colleagues who will spend the weekend vying to win the support of Tory MPs before nominations close.Miss Mordaunt, the Leader of the Commons, is also expected to run after coming third in the last contest.The former defence secretary previously faced criticism for her 'woke' views on trans rights, and was warned against running by colleagues last night.One said her views on trans rights would 'put a lot of people off' and suggested she lacked experience for the top job.Around half a dozen MPs had publicly backed Miss Mordaunt on Thursday night, including Digital Minister Damian Collins, who said she has the 'quality and experience to unite the party and rebuild trust in government'.Tory backbencher John Lamont said Miss Mordaunt 'is exactly the kind of calm, cool and collected leader we need right now'.Other possible candidates include ex-home secretary Suella Braverman, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, Justice Secretary Brandon Lewis and International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch.Allies of Mr Lewis said last night that he 'hasn't made any decisions' but MPs were 'turning towards him in a way that we haven't seen before'.Newly-appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps ruled himself out of the race.Earlier, Sir Graham Brady said that after talks with the board of the Conservative Party and the executive of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers that he chairs, nominations begin straight away and will close at 2pm on Monday.'We fixed a high threshold but a threshold that should be achievable by any serious candidate who has a prospect of going through,' he told reporters outside Parliament.Party chairman Sir Jake Berry said Conservative HQ will be working with broadcasters to arrange one broadcast event so members can hear from the final two candidates - if there are two - before they vote. Ms Truss dramatically admitted defeat and announced she is quitting as PM today, with Westminster gearing up for Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak to do 'battle for the soul' of the party. As Ms Truss time in power came shuddering to an ignominious end:Sterling shot up to $1.13 before the speech as markets anticipated that Ms Truss would resign, and then pared back gains slightly to stand 0.4 per cent higher at $1.126 after her resignation statement; Labour leader Keir Starmer has twisted the knife by demanding an immediate general election;Ms Truss will be entitled to £19,000 severance after around 51 days as PM, while Mr Johnson would not have to return a payoff because more than three weeks has passed;  Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has launched an investigation into the claims of bullying during the votes last night; The Pound has dropped to $1.119 against the US dollar, its lowest level for a week, as markets digest the political turmoil.. The candidates could include the former PM, who has been backed by some MPs to run to return to power. But he remains on holiday in the Caribbean and faces a race against time to return and launch an effective campaign.. By Martin Beckford, Policy Editor for the Daily Mail The highly-anticipated Halloween Budget may no longer go ahead as planned because of the change in Prime Minister.Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng had been forced to bring forward their detailed financial plans from late November to Monday, October 31, under pressure from the City to show they could balance the books.New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt this week vowed to keep the date for the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan and immediately started discussing spending cuts with Whitehall departments, declaring that 'decisions of eye-watering difficulty' would have to be taken.But Miss Truss's dramatic downfall and the rapid Tory leadership election to replace her could now see the statement postponed or even cancelled, rising fresh turmoil in currency and bond markets.If the new leader is not chosen until next Friday, it would give them just a weekend to consider the far-reaching economic plans before they were due to be announced.The winner of the contest may want to change the balance of tax rises, spending cuts and changes to the welfare system needed to fill an estimated £40billion budget black hole.A Whitehall source said the Halloween date was 'still the plan' but added: 'It's a decision for new PM ultimately.'Chairman of the Conservative party's backbench 1922 committee Sir Graham Brady indicated that the budget could still go ahead as scheduled despite the tight timetable.He said yesterday: 'I have spoken to the party chairman Jake Berry and he has confirmed it will be possible to conduct a ballot and conclude a leadership election by Friday, October 28. So we should have a new leader in place before the fiscal statement on October 31.'During the summer Miss Truss pledged to hold an emergency budget if she won the leadership contest in order to provide urgent help for families suffering from the cost of living crisis.In her first act as Prime Minister she announced that household energy bills would be frozen for two years, costing an estimated £150billion. When her Chancellor Mr Kwarteng delivered what was expected to be a 'mini-Budget' on September 23, however, it went far further than anyone had expected.His Growth Plan bet that £45billion worth of spending cuts funded by borrowing would put rocket boosters under the economy, and involved slashing the basic rate of income tax as well as cancelling a planned hike in corporation tax.But he also said he would axe the top 45p rate of income tax and lift the cap on bankers' bonuses, sparking outrage from Tories as well as opposition MPs who said it was wrong for the richest in society to benefit when so many are struggling.And, fatally, the tax cuts were published without the usual accompanying forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog – meaning that investors had no idea how they would be paid for.Mr Kwarteng initially said he would set out his medium-term fiscal plan on November 23rd, two months after the tax cuts were announced.But he was forced to bring it forward to Hallowe'en amid turmoil in the bond markets that wiped billions off the value of pension funds, drove up mortgage rates for homeowners and triggered a dramatic intervention by the Bank of England.Mr Kwarteng also had to U-turn on the 45p tax rate cut, but when this failed to calm financial markets he was sacked just a week ago - with his successor Mr Hunt unceremoniously cancelling almost all of his other plans.Last night the Treasury declined to comment on whether or not the Hallowe'en statement would still go ahead.One insider said: 'It will be up to the new Prime Minister. But internally we're still working very much to what's been announced, unless told otherwise.' Advertisement. After just 44 disastrous days in No10, Ms Truss took to a lectern outside the famous black door to confirm her departure, sealing her fate as the shortest-serving premier in modern political history.Revealing she had informed the King of her decision, she said: 'I cannot deliver on the mandate.... I will remain as PM until a successor has been chosen.' Ms Truss - who insisted she was a 'fighter not a quitter' barely 24 hours ago - said the Tory leadership contest will be completed over the next week. Giving her valedictory statement, she was watched by husband Hugh. Attention immediately turns to the leadership battle - with Jeremy Hunt ruling himself out within minutes. However, there are claims that Boris Johnson - currently on holiday in the Caribbean - will bid for a shock return just six weeks after he left office. His MP supporters have been saying it is 'time to come back', but other politicians warned it would be 'f***ing madness' and said some colleagues could choose to defect if he won. 'It ended in chaos with 57 ministers resigning. He lost the confidence of the parliamentary party,' they added. A Boris-supporting former Cabinet minister shot back: 'If we lose 10 MPs we've still got a majority of 51... he's got the stardust that the others simply do not have..'  Friends of Rishi Sunak told MailOnline he is almost certain to stand. One close ally told MailOnline there would be a 'natural logic' to him facing off against Mr Johnson. 'It will be a battle for the soul of the party,' they added.The high bar is expected to rule out many hopefuls, potentially including Penny Mordaunt as well as Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch, and Brandon Lewis. Conservative 1922 Committee chair Sir Graham Brady told journalists in Westminster that a replacement should be in place by October 28, in time for the Halloween Budget. He suggested that the membership could be 'involved' on that schedule, but refused to give details of how.    The bombshelll news follows a week of carnage that saw a bewildering array of U-turns on the mini-Budget, the Chancellor and Home Secretary quit, confusion over whether the Chief Whip had followed her out of the door, and MPs wrestling in Commons voting lobbies.A slew of apocalyptic polls showing Labour up to 36 points ahead had also fuelled outright panic in the Parliamentary party. Ms Truss held crisis talks with Sir Graham, deputy PM Therese Coffey and Tory chair Jake Berry in the building earlier, as they delivered grim message about the mood of the party.  A series of previously-loyal MPs joined calls for her to go this morning. Even supportive Cabinet ministers had been conceding the situation is 'terminal'.Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan was sent out to prop up the PM this morning, but would only say that 'at the moment' she believes Ms Truss will lead the Tories into the next election. The main obstacle to removing Ms Truss over recent days was the lack of consensus on who should take over and what the process should be, with little appetite for a drawn-out contest. Nadine Dorries has warned the only person who would be acceptable in a 'coronation' is Mr Johnson. In order to restrict the field, there is likely to be a very high threshold of nominations to get on the ballot - perhaps 100. The 1922 committee could seek tacit agreement from candidates that they will step aside if they are not in pole position when the field is whittled down to a final two. That would avoid the need for a run-off vote of the entire party membership.Events accelerated after another bout of madness at Westminster yesterday culminated in stories of tears and tantrums in Parliament, with Ms Truss allegedly engaging in a shouting match with her own enforcers.Deputy PM Therese Coffey was accused of 'manhandling' Tory MPs to vote against a Labour motion that could have killed the government's plans to resume fracking - something she denies.The premier tried to force the issue by declaring that it was a matter of confidence, meaning a defeat the would have collapsed the government. But at the end of the debate a minister declared that it was not in fact a confidence vote - triggering fury from Chief Whip Wendy Morton and her deputy Craig Whittaker. Other whips told MPs they had resigned, but after three hours of silence and frantic wrangling behind the scenes Downing Street announced they were still in post. A 1.33am statement then made clear that it had been a confidence vote, warning that around 30 MPs who abstained will be disciplined. However, in another twist this morning, Ms Trevelyan said that it had not been a confidence vote. The PM lost her second Cabinet heavyweight in five days after Suella Braverman resigned as Home Secretary, admitting using of her personal email to campaign against the government's own immigration policy - but also hit out at Ms Truss for ditching key policies, suggesting she should also quit for 'mistakes'.  The PM appointed Grants Shapps, a Rishi Sunak supporter who as late as Monday was telling media that her government was unsustainable.. After just 44 days in No10 - the shortest term in modern political history - the PM took to a lectern outside the famous black door to confirm her departure. Ms Truss was watched by husband Hugh as she delivered her emotional announcement in Downing Street today. Afterwards the PM and her husband wa;led disconsolately back into the building, where they took up residence little over a month ago. Boris Johnson ally James Duddridge said it was 'time to come back' as he mulls another bid for Downing Street. A 'PM4PM' Twitter campaign, run by grassroots supporters of Penny Mordaunt, began within minutes of Ms Truss quitting in Downing Street today. Liz Truss quits LIVE: Boris weighs up running for PM as 1922.... Can the Tories REALLY appoint a new leader in a week? New PM.... 'Wounded' Liz Truss feigned a 'smile to mask her true.... Liz Truss's resignation statement in full. Minister James Duddridge said it was time for a comeback by Boris Johnson.Tweeting with the hashtag #bringbackboris, he said: 'I hope you enjoyed your holiday boss. Time to come back. Few issues at the office that need addressing.'Sir James served as a parliamentary private secretary to Mr Johnson when he was in No 10.Another frontbencher, Brendan Clarke-Smith, said he thought Mr Johnson would be 'potentially' interested.'We need someone who can come in, we need somebody who can bring people together, somebody who actually has got that mandate. So a mandate from people in the last general election, a mandate from party members and somebody actually who can get this party going again, get us winning elections again,' he told Sky News.'The only person that I think that ticks all those boxes is Boris Johnson.'But other MPs warned that the idea of the ex-PM returning is 'mad'.Former prime minister Theresa May also dropped a broad hint at her view by warning Tory MPs must ensure there is a 'sensible, competent government'.She said: 'The Prime Minister is right to provide a roadmap for an orderly transition.'MPs must now be prepared to compromise.'It is our duty to provide sensible, competent government at this critical moment for our country.'Ms Truss's announcement came after Sir Graham gave a privately grim assessment of her survival prospects.'I came into office at a time of great economic and international instability.'Families and businesses were worried about how to pay their bills.'Putin's illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security of our whole continent.'And our country had been held back for too long by low economic growth.'I was elected by the Conservative Party with a mandate to change this.'We delivered on energy bills and on cutting national insurance.'And we set out a vision for a low tax, high growth economy – that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit.'I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party.Ms Truss said that the contest should 'be completed within the next week'.'This will ensure that we remain on a path to deliver our fiscal plan and maintain our country's economic stability and national security,' she added.. Chased, stabbed and left in a coma after leaving a pub in Cambridge. 'I will remain as Prime Minister until a successor has been chosen.'Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded a general election 'now' so that the nation can have 'a chance at a fresh start'.The Conservatives are set to appoint their third prime minister on the mandate won by Mr Johnson in December 2019.Sir Keir said: 'The Conservative Party has shown it no longer has a mandate to govern.'The British public deserve a proper say on the country's future. They must have the chance to compare the Tories' chaos with Labour's plans to sort out their mess, grow the economy for working people and rebuild the country for a fairer, greener future.'We must have a chance at a fresh start. We need a general election – now.'As MPs lined up against Ms Truss earlier, Tory backbencher Gary Streeter said he believed she must go, but warned that even the 'Angel Gabriel' will struggle to lead the party because it lacks 'discipline, mutual respect and teamwork'. Fellow Conservative Sheryl Murray said: 'I had high hopes for Liz Truss but after what happened last night her position has become untenable and I have submitted a letter to Sir Graham Brady.' Truss is shortest serving PM ever. Liz Truss is now the shortest serving prime minister in British history.She clocked up 44 full days in the role – a long way behind the next shortest premiership, that of Tory statesman George Canning, who spent 118 full days as PM in 1827 before dying in office from ill health.Ms Truss was to have overtaken this number of days on January 3 2023.But instead she will fall short by more than two months, with the next prime minister due to be elected within the next week.Some PMs have had shorter terms, but gone on to take charge in No10 again.   Advertisement. Hendon MP Matthew Offord told the Evening Standard said Ms Truss needs to make a 'dignified exit'. 'I can't see the situation being sustainable. She does need to sit down and discuss it with her Cabinet and with others to manage some kind of dignified exit.' Crawley MP Henry Smith told Times Radio that the Conservatives 'cannot delay' getting rid of the premier.Tory Jill Mortimer, who shocked Labour by winning the Hartlepool by-election just last year, shared an image of her letter of no confidence on Facebook.She added: 'Yesterday, I tried to get called in PMQs to ask Liz Truss for an assurance of support for our town and our promises.'Sadly I was not called and the deteriorating situation throughout the day left me with no choice but to submit a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister to Sir Graham Brady.'Senior MP Simon Hoare told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'm a glass half full sort of person. Can the ship be turned around? Yes. But I think there's about 12 hours to do it.'I think today and tomorrow are crunch days. I have never known – OK, I've only been an MP for seven years – but a growing sense of pessimism in all wings of the Tory party.'In a rant during an interview that was retweeted by colleagues, veteran Conservative MP Charles Walker said: 'I think it's a shambles and a disgrace. I think it is utterly appalling. I am livid.'Last night Conservative MPs were confident that between 50 and 100 letters of no confidence had been submitted to Sir Graham, despite current rules stating the committee cannot hold a vote of confidence in Liz Truss for a year after her appointment. After the government declared yesterday morning that the vote on banning fracking was an issue of confidence, climate minister Graham Stuart told the Commons it was not a confidence motion after all.Deputy chief whip Craig Whittaker had written to Conservatives telling them it is a '100 per cent hard 3 line whip!''We cannot, under any circumstances, let the Labour Party take control of the order paper and put through their own legislation and whatever other bits of legislation they desire,' he said.'We are voting NO and I reiterate, this is a hard 3 line whip with all slips withdrawn.'The last-minute shift caused Ms Morton to storm out of the Chamber, before reportedly publicly declaring 'I am no longer the Chief Whip' while standing just a metre away from the PM.While Tory MPs were originally telling reporters that both the Chief Whip and her Deputy, Craig Whittaker, had quit their roles and handed in resignation letters, confusion soon intensified after it was reported Liz Truss followed Ms Morton and pulled her into an intense meeting to prevent her quitting.  Mr Whittaker reportedly declared as he walked out of the division lobby: 'I am f***ing furious and I don't give a f*** any more.'For several hours, no-one from the government could confirm or deny the claims that both the top whips had resigned. When pressed on issue, Business Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was 'not clear' what the 'situation' with the whips was. By 9pm, Ms Coffey was telling reporters outside the Carlton Club - where with exquisite timing the entire Cabinet was due to attend a dinner for the centenary of the agreement that sunk Lloyd George's government - that Ms Morton had won a 'great victory' by defeating the Labour motion. No10 confirmed at 9.49pm that the pair were indeed remaining in post.. Chief Whip Wendy Morton and Tory chair Jake Berry were seen going in and out of Downing Street today, although that in itself is not unusual. Suella Braverman returned home from the school run this morning after quitting as Home Secretary yesterday amid claims she had a 90-minute row with the PM over immigration first. The barely believable scenes in the division lobbies - captured on camera by Labour MP Chris Bryant in defiance of Commons rules - were the latest evidence of the wheels falling off Liz Truss's administration  Who takes over now? Tory leadership election will last just a WEEK and new leader will be installed by Friday 28 October as party squabbles over who can be the 'unity candidate' Liz Truss's bombshell resignation today sets up a lighting fast election for a new Tory leader with no obvious unity candidate to take over.Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are both considering a new run at power in the contest that Tories hope will select a new leader by Friday October 28.This would put the new leader in place in time for a crucial financial statement on October 31 which is intended to reassure the City of London that the Government has a plan to repair the nation's finances.Sir Graham said there was an expectation that Tory members would be involved in the process but 'I think we're deeply conscious of the imperative in the national interest of resolving this clearly and quickly'.The party is keen to avoid a re-run of the summer's bitter and protracted 55-day race in which Ms Truss beat Mr Sunak. That race saw both sides engage in bitter blue-on-blue infighting, mainly over the economy, that did not help the party in the polls. Ms Truss spent more than an hour in talks with 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, Tory chairman Jake Berry and deputy PM Therese Coffey this morning.Afterwards, announcing her resignation after just 44 days she revealed they had agreed a truncated election campaign lasting a week.Sir Graham told reporters that he wants to run it, including possibly a vote of 160,000 party members, before the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt makes the fiscal statement on spending on October 31. Asked if the party faithful will be included in the process, he told reporters: 'Well, that is the expectation.'So the reason I've spoken to the party chairman and I discussed the parameters of a process is to look at how we can make the whole thing happen, including the party being consulted, by Friday next week.'Sir Graham added: 'I think we're deeply conscious of the imperative in the national interest of resolving this clearly and quickly.'They appear to be pinning their hopes on a single unity candidate can be identified who can effectively step in and avoid any further unpleasantness, with the party hemorrhaging support in the polls.However, that unity candidate has yet to emerge, with several big names suggesting it should be them. Those in the frame include Mr Sunak, the former chancellor, Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.. Liz Truss's bombshell resignation today sets up a lighting fast election for a new Tory leader with no obvious unity candidate to take over.. The party is keen to avoid a re-run of the summer's bitter and protracted 55-day race in which Ms Truss beat Mr Sunak.. The the main obstacle remains the lack of consensus on who should take over and what the process should be, with little appetite for a drawn-out contest. There are signs leadership battle lines are already being drawn, with former minister Crispin Blunt openly calling for Jeremy Hunt to get the keys to No10.Nadine Dorries warned the only person who could return in a 'coronation' is Boris Johnson. Other MPs want Rishi Sunak or Penny Mordaunt to take over.One senior MP, not previously a fan of the ex-PM, told MailOnline Sir Graham has to come up with a 'plan'. 'Bring back Boris or get Jeremy Hunt in. If you get Boris back in you just hit the reset button,' they said.One idea being pushed by influential Tories is that MPs vote on a successor, but there is a very high threshold of nominations to get on the ballot.The 1922 committee could ask candidates to agree that they will step aside if they are not in pole position when the field is whittled down to a final two. That would avoid the need for a run-off vote of the entire party membership.A source said of the blueprint: 'That has been put to someone very senior in the party, very, very senior.'Ms Truss has said she will stay on as Prime Minister until a successor is chosen via a leadership election to be held within the next week.Speaking in Downing Street, she said: 'This morning I met the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady.. Liz Truss quits LIVE: Boris weighs up running for PM as 1922.... Can the Tories REALLY appoint a new leader in a week? New PM.... 'Wounded' Liz Truss feigned a 'smile to mask her true.... Nadine Dorries, a staunch ally of the former prime minister and a backer of Liz Truss, made a fresh appeal to doubting Conservative MPs to stand behind the current leader. But the former Culture Secretary said 'only one MP has a mandate' from both the Tory party and the British public – Mr JohnsonHowever defence minister James Heappey threw shade at the ex-PM today.  The  Armed Forces Minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was no alternative unity candidate and defended Ms Truss, saying that at least she had apologised quicker than Boris Johnson did when he was prime minister.Last night Tory plotters were told to reinstate Mr Johnson to No 10 or face a general election 'within weeks'.Nadine Dorries, a staunch ally of the former prime minister and a backer of Ms Truss, made a fresh appeal to doubting Conservative MPs to stand behind the current leader.In recent weeks she has called for Ms Truss to hold a fresh election if she was insistent on wavering over her predecessor's policies.But the former Culture Secretary said 'only one MP has a mandate' from both the Tory party and the British public – Mr Johnson.RISHI SUNAK The former Chancellor, 42, was the runner-up in this summer's Tory leadership race.He and Ms Truss went head-to-head as the final pairing in the contest to replace Boris Johnson in No10.They engaged in bitter exchanges over their economic agendas during a lengthy series of hustings events across the UK.Now that Ms Truss has abandoned almost all her leadership pledges on tax cuts - and is adopting much of the approach pursued by Mr Sunak when he was Chancellor - some MPs will be wondering why they don't just put him in charge instead.A number of his supporters are also likely to take a 'told you so' attitude to the Government's current travails - after Mr Sunak's warned this summer of market turmoil if Ms Truss followed through with her unfunded tax cuts.. Mr Sunak won the support of 137 MPs in the initial stages of the Tory leadership contest - 24 more than Ms Truss - and retains a strong backing within the parliamentary party.After overseeing the Government's economic response to the Covid crisis, he also has experience of political leadership in turbulent times.MPs might be wary of installing a leader who was rejected by the Tory membership little more than a month ago.There is also lingering resentment at Mr Sunak for his resignation as Chancellor in July, which many of Mr Johnson's loyalists still blame for the former PM's ousting from No10.But a new poll today suggests the grassroots of the party may be more accepting than previously thought. The poll of Conservative members by JL Partners for the Daily Telegraph found that 60 per cent of them would now back Mr Sunak for party leader, once undecided and non-voting members are excluded. More than four-in-10 (43 per cent) would support him outright, to Truss's (28 per cent)JEREMY HUNT The 55-year-old was a shock appointment as the new Chancellor on Friday following Ms Truss's sacking of her ally Kwasi Kwarteng.He is now being referred to among some Tory MPs as the 'de facto PM' after he tore up what remained of Ms Truss's mini-Budget plans and outlined a completely new economic agenda.Mr Hunt is being talked up as a potential 'unity' candidate behind which the competing wings of the Conservative Party could rally behind, amid the current economic crisis.He is an experienced Cabinet minister and is the longest-serving Health Secretary in British political history following his spell in charge of the NHS between 2012 and 2018.Mr Hunt has also previously served as Foreign Secretary and Culture Secretary and would be seen as a safe pair of hands.. Jeremy Hunt has replaced Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor - but he has ruled out a tilt at the top job and urged MPs to give Ms Truss 'a chance'There have been suggestions he could enter No10 as a 'caretaker' PM to steady the ship before another leader is elected.But Mr Hunt himself is distancing himself from talk about his leadership chances and has ruled out a tilt at the top job as he called on MPs to give Ms Truss 'a chance'.'I rule it out, Mrs Hunt rules it out, three Hunt children rule it out,' he told Sky News.During this summer's Tory leadership contest, Mr Hunt was knocked out in the first round of voting by MPs when he attracted the support of just 18 colleagues.It is this recent demonstration of a paucity of support for Mr Hunt - who went on to support Mr Sunak against Ms Truss - among Conservative MPs that would count against him if he changed his mind.He was previously the runner-up to Mr Johnson in the 2019 Tory leadership election, in which he was roundly rejected by Tory members.Following his elimination from this summer's contest, Mr Hunt had appeared to admit his hopes of ever seizing the Tory crown were over.'It's become obvious to me you only get one big shot at this, and I had mine in 2019.' he said at the time. PENNY MORDAUNT The Leader of the House of Commons, 49, came close to reaching the final round of this summer's Tory leadership contest.She finished third behind Ms Truss and Mr Sunak when she secured the support of 105 MPs.The Royal Navy reservist has since been drafted back into the Cabinet, where she previously served as Defence Secretary under Theresa May's premiership.But, this summer's leadership contest saw questions raised about Ms Mordaunt's ministerial record.There was stinging criticism of Ms Mordaunt's work ethic as she was accused of going missing from her ministerial duties by rival camps.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who was Ms Mordaunt's former boss, moaned about she had 'not been available' at various times as a trade minister and left others to 'pick up the pieces'.. Penny Mordaunt finished third behind Ms Truss and Mr Sunak in this summer's Tory leadership contest when she secured the support of 105 MPsIt was claimed Ms Mordaunt had instead spent her time focusing on preparations for her leadership campaign.She also had to fight hard during the Tory leadership contest against criticism of her stance on trans issues, including her past claim that 'trans women are women'.Ms Mordaunt blasted critics trying to depict her as 'woke'.One suggestion at Westminster is the possibility of Ms Mordaunt teaming up with Mr Sunak as part of a joint ticket to replace Ms Truss.But plotters are said to be undecided on who would be PM out of the pair, if they were to front a 'government of all the talents' between them.Last night it was reported that Ms Mordaunt's allies reached out to Mr Sunak to be her chancellor, but were rebuffed.BEN WALLACEThe 52-year-old is popular with Tory members following the Defence Secretary's efforts in leading Britain's military response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.He is also being spoken of as a 'unity' candidate to bring the party back together, should Ms Truss depart.The former Army officer has routinely topped the polls among the Conservatives grassroots.But he did not enter this summer's leadership contest after 'careful consideration' and later backed Ms Truss.At this month's Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Mr Wallace admitted he was 'conflicted' about a possible leadership bid in the future. He told a fringe event: 'At this time of life, the idea was no. I mean do I rule it out? No. I don't rule it out, but will I be here in a few years' time? I don't know either.'. The hardline Brexiteer was handed the top job as an acknowledgement of her popularity with the right of the party in the summer leadership contest, and for switching to Team Truss when she was knocked out.She hit out at MPs who voted against tough new measures to strengthen police powers to deal with activists more quickly.Addressing the Commons as MPs debated the Public Order Bill, Mrs Braverman said: 'I'm afraid it's the Labour Party, it's the Lib Dems, it's the coalition of chaos, it's the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati – dare I say, the anti-growth coalition – that we have to thank for the disruption we are seeing on our roads today.'Her comments came as police arrested two Just Stop Oil protesters who spent 36 hours suspended from the QEII bridge, closing a major transport link between Kent and Essex due to safety fears.At the Conservative Party conference a fortnight ago she also attacked the PM for U-turning over plans to axe the 45p top rate of income tax.She launched a swipe as the PM tried to regain her balance, branding the U-turn on axing the 45p tax rate 'disappointing' and accusing rebels of a 'coup'.She was also blamed recently for jeopardizing a free trade deal with India by accusing its people of being the worst at overstaying visas in the UK..

A revamped version of Special Ops will launch alongside the full game (pic: Activision)More details are surfacing about Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s take on Special Ops mode, which will go live after the official launch.. You’ve officially entered the final countdown to Modern Warfare 2’s launch, with less than a week remaining until the game unlocks across all platforms.. As usual, the game will have a co-op mode, but rather than Zombies it’ll be the Special Ops mode that always used to be part of Infinity Ward’s games.. At first, Special Ops will launch with three missions, though Activision has confirmed that more will be added in the future, including extra difficult endgame raids. These will be large-scale missions that take place in Al Mazrah, the new map location for Warzone 2.. When playing this mode, you’ll have access to a backpack to store equipment and one of three kits, which are like having a set of perks, field upgrades, and killstreaks in the game’s multiplayer.. Each kit has its own set of perks, so choose wisely! (pic: Activision)These kits are levelled up by earning stars through missions and mission-related challenges, which Activision say will give all three of these launch missions plenty of replayability.. You’ll also want to complete the Special Ops missions and have at least one kit levelled up to rank 5 before raids arrive post-launch, and after December 14 as part of the season 1 reloaded update. Most likely kits have already been factored into these raids, as they’re directly related to the Special Ops missions.. So, now that you’ve learned all there is to know about the kits in the Special Ops mode, let’s see what the first three missions will actually look like.. What are the Special Ops missions in Modern Warfare 2?. All three Special Ops missions will take place in Al Mazrah, which is a brand new map that was introduced in Warzone 2 only a month ago. Though it’s part of the Region Of Adal, which is a desert map, it’s very different to the rest of it, as it features high-rise skyscrapers and modern buildings.. You’ll be able to do this with the help of a vehicle, which will help you escape to a nearby exfil plane, once the mission is complete.. Make sure you put your night vision goggles on (pic: Activision)Another mission, named Low Profile will have you and your teammates infiltrate a town in the dead of night to uncover intel and evidence left behind by Al Qatala – an anarchist terrorist organisation. Stealth is key to surviving this mission, so you better equip either an assault or a medic kit.. The third mission of the Special Ops mode is called Defender: Mt Zaya and it’ll throw you in the middle of a local observatory to defend it against enemies attempting to detonate bombs.. On that note, there’s no announcement for a Zombies mode in Modern Warfare 2. Most fans feel the mode is in need of a revamp though and since it was never originally part of Modern Warfare it’s not surprising it’s giving this year a miss..

Read our privacy noticeLiz Truss has become the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history, resigning after just 45 days in office. After a meeting with Sir Graham Brady, chair of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, at Downing Street on Thursday, Ms Truss told the nation it was clear she could no longer deliver the “mandate” she had been given by her party just weeks earlier.The backbench rebellion and market turmoil sparked by the disastrous “mini-Budget” which Ms Truss and her then-chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, introduced in late September, finally caught up to her. Keir Starmerhas now demanded a general election.From Theresa May to Boris Johnson and now Ms Truss, the UK has had a relatively high turnover of prime ministers in recent years, following the divisive vote to leave the European Union in 2016.Here, The Independent takes a look at some of the shortest serving UK prime ministers in modern history.RecommendedLiz Truss news – live: PM resigns after less than seven weeks in Downing StreetTimeline: Key moments in Liz Truss’s 45 days as prime ministerKeir Starmer calls for immediate general election after Truss resignsGeorge Canning: 119 daysTory George Canning replaced Lord Liverpool as prime minister on 10 April 1827 and formed a coalition with the Whigs under Lord Lansdowne.He died on 8 August 1827, having spent just five months in office. He died suddenly from pneumonia at Chiswick House. Canning subsequently became regarded by some as a “lost leader” amid speculation about what would have happened had he lived.Bonar Law: 209 daysBonar Law, the Canadian-born son of a Scottish clergyman, was elected to parliament in 1900 as the Conservative MP for Glasgow Blackfriars. He had a reputation for fearlessness and was regarded as an effective speaker.Conservative withdrawal from the Liberal-Conservative coalition government forced Lloyd George to resign and the King then invited Law to form a new administration in 1922.But he was forced to resign in May 1923 because of ill health and died of throat cancer six months later. Bonar resigned as PM due to ill health (PA)Sir Alec Douglas-Home: 1 year, 1 monthSir Alec Douglas-Home, a Conservative, became prime minister in October 1963 but found himself out of office the following year, having spent just one year and one day in the top job.He entered No 10 in October as a result of political manoeuvring by his predecessor, Harold Macmillan, who was determined to prevent the succession of Rab Butler, the former foreign secretary. Macmillan had resigned after a series of economic woes and scandals, the most damaging of which involved the minister John Profumo.Born into an aristocratic family, and educated at both Eton College and Oxford University, Sir Alec was viewed by the public as out of touch and was defeated by Labour’s Harold Wilson in the 1964 general election.Sir Alec was viewed by the public as out of touch (PA)Sir Anthony Eden: 1 year 9 monthsBorn in Rushyford, Durham, Sir Anthony Eden was elected to parliament in 1923 and would later serve as foreign secretary three times during the Second World War and the Cold War.He was widely regarded as Sir Winston Churchill’s successor and took over from the wartime PM in 1955 at the age of 57.But he was forced to quit just over a year later as a result of his disastrous handling of the Suez crisis. Sir Anthony was created Earl of Avon in 1961 and died in January 1977.Eden was forced to quit over the Suez crisis (PA)Gordon Brown: 2 years 11 monthsFormer Labour prime minister Gordon Brown was first elected to parliament in 1983 as the MP for Dunfermline East.He took over from Tony Blair as PM in 2007 and just a year later was forced to deal with the aftermath of the financial crisis.Despite being credited with doing a job in handling the crash by propping up the banks, Mr Brown was defeated in the 2010 election by Conservative David Cameron.Brown’s tenure in No 10 marked the end of Labour’s domination in Westminster. (PA)Theresa May: 3 yearsTheresa May was first elected to parliament in 1997 as the MP for Maidenhead.May resigned in 2019 with her premiership dominated by Brexit. (PA)Boris Johnson resigned in July 2022 – less than three years after leading the Conservative Party to its biggest general election victory since 1987.Mr Johnson had been under pressure over a succession of scandals, including lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street and Whitehall during the Covid pandemic.The Chris Pincher affair was the straw that broke the camel’s back. The former PM hired Mr Pincher as deputy chief whip despite being aware of a formal complaint about the MP’s behaviour.It emerged after Mr Pincher had the whip removed after being accused of groping two men at a private members’ club in London on 29 June.Liz Truss: 45 daysPrime minister Liz Truss making a statement outside 10 Downing Street, London, where she announced her resignation (PA Wire)RecommendedRishi Sunak to meet King Charles as Truss defends her record - liveJohnson was ‘begging people for votes’ in a ‘demeaning’ way, says IDSWelcome, PM Sunak – the last best option to take over from TrussLiz Truss resigned as prime minister on 20 October, following weeks of questions about her future in the aftermath of September’s disastrous mini-Budget.After just 44 days in office, the prime minister said she “cannot deliver the mandate” she was elected on but will remain in place until her successor has been chosen by the Conservative Party..

Log inRuark R1 MK4 Best: OverallConnectivity type: Bluetooth, USB-C, Aux, headphones outAlarm: DualRadio tuner: DAB, DAB+, FMBuy for £239If there was an award for “most perfectly radio-looking radio”, the Ruark R1 MK4 would win. Actually, we’ve just decided to create that award: congratulations, Ruark! The R1 MK4 is the fourth iteration of a famous model, and the best of the bunch. The gorgeous, hand-crafted wood grille neatly hides a heap of features and a sophisticated soundstage that has no right to be in such a compact box. It’s not just DAB, either, with a Bluetooth receiver letting you besmirch the audio technology with your choice of embarrassing Spotify playlists.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£239 Johnlewis.comBuy nowBack to topRoberts revival istream 3 Best: For tradition and tech in oneConnectivity: Bluetooth, USB, Aux, wifi, headphones out, line inAlarm: Buzzer, radioRadio tuner: DAB, FM, InternetBuy for £229.99The Roberts Revival series of radios is perhaps the best you can get. It hits the sweet spot between modern audio technology and retro styling, perfectly shown by the istream 3. Don’t let the attractive 1960s design fool you – the istream 3 has all the mod cons you could shake a digital stick at, from DAB and internet radio to Spotify and USB connectivity. All this is a bonus, though, as it’s the sound quality that’s the primary takeaway – it’s among the cleanest, most-balanced performances on the market for this price.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£229.99 Johnlewis.comBuy nowBack to topSony XDR-S4ID Best: Reliable budget radioConnectivity: UnspecifiedAlarm: RadioRadio tuner: DAB+, FMBuy for £74Beauty is much more than skin deep. Granted, the Sony XDR-S4ID won’t be to everyone’s modern-sleek-chrome-no-buttons-all-curves tastes, but this little powerhouse scans for your favourite channels, offering five presets. (A word of warning: these will disappear if you’re using batteries and they run out.) It’s easy to take with you, the sound is capable without pulling up any trees, and the LED screen is very early years of DAB. Not much to dislike, a load to enjoy.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£74 Amazon.co.ukBuy nowBack to topLumie bodyclock luxe 750DAB Best: For starting the day rightConnectivity: Bluetooth, USB, AuxAlarm: Brightening lightRadio tuner: DAB, DAB+Buy for £229Let’s face it, the British winter can feel a little on the long side (and this is from a dyed-in-the-wool winter apologist). The short days and dark mornings can begin to weigh on our mood, which is why the concept of the light alarm clock is such a winner. The bodyclock luxe 750DAB is at the top of the tree when it comes to starting your winter mornings on the right foot – its gradual, natural daylight-mimicking tech helps you to wake up in a gentle, energised fashion, with 20 sounds that can accompany your own little sunrise. If you fancy a radio wake-up call, the bodyclock luxe also has Bluetooth, DAB and USB connectivity, with a more-than-handy audio setup.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£229 Lumie.comBuy nowBack to topLoewe klang S1Best: For looksConnectivity: Bluetooth, USB, wifiAlarm: N/aRadio tuner: DAB, DAB+, FMBuy for £459Loewe has made it clear what its Klang range is all about. German for “sound”, the klang S1 packs plenty of the stuff into its sleek silhouette, combining DAB/DAB+/FM/internet radio tuning with integrated streaming and crystal-clear speaker setup.The S1 is among the most design-forward radios on the list, the aluminium housing coming in basalt and light grey, and the compact frame taking up very little room. It’s a classic minimalist German design that would look at home just about anywhere and make you feel slightly better about the conspicuous pile of washing hiding in the kitchen.Configuring and programming the S1 is straightforward via the set’s impressively large top display, the remote control or the partner Loewe radio app. With up to 25,000 stations available, we suggest the app.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£459 Amazon.co.ukBuy nowBack to topRoberts revival petiteBest: For portabilityConnectivity: Bluetooth, AuxAlarm: N/aRadio tuner: DAB, DAB+, FMBuy for £99The Roberts Revival range does it again with the petite. The name is apt: it’s a tiny radio that fits pretty neatly in hand, but still manages to give off a premium air. The Roberts retro design approach comes into its own here, creating a DAB pocket rocket (10 DAB and 10 FM presets) that offers a clear screen, big tuning knob and amp-style speaker grille. The petite also connects to your favourite streaming services via Bluetooth, and has a 12-hour wireless battery life, meaning you can take your old-school looks with you wherever you go.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£99 Johnlewis.comBuy nowBack to topRuark audio R3Best: For sound qualityConnectivity: Bluetooth, wifi, RCA in, RCA out, optical in, USB, ethernet, headphonesAlarm: Buzzer, dual, programmable timer, radioRadio tuner: DAB, DAB+, FMBuy for £649It feels a little unfair to the rest of the list to class the Ruark R3 as a DAB radio. Its smart-radio tuner offers internet radio, DAB, DAB+ and FM, with access to stations and podcasts worldwide, including a raft of on-demand services.However, the R3 offers much more than Greg James (although we’d be happy enough with that). It’s a fantastic all-in-one music streaming and CD system that produces sound much richer and louder than its size would suggest. It’s also a beautiful piece of tech art that would elevate any room. If you’re looking for a centrepiece audio player, and have the cash to spare, the R3 is the way to go.Continue reading...Recommended retailer£649 Johnlewis.comBuy nowBack to topThe verdict: DAB radiosThe Roberts revival range is one of the most consistently high-quality audio ranges we’ve had the pleasure to listen to, especially for the price, but its istream and petite radios are just pipped to the best buy title by Ruark’s class-leading R1 Mk4. The handmade wooden grille and left-field shape gives Ruark the crown, but either would be a worthy addition to your kitchen or bedside.In the mood for something classic?

      "Modern Warfare 2 pre-load times and dates for consoles and PC | Metro News. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 pre-load times and dates for consoles and PC. Modern Warfare 2 is almost here (pic: Activision)Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is out very soon but if you want to get it as early as possible you should check the times for when you can pre-load it.. Modern Warfare 2 is out on Friday, October 28 and promises to add a suite of new features to its multiplayer, ranging from aquatic combat to a third person mode.. On top of that, Activision has decided to roll out the game’s campaign mode a week earlier than usual, to give you more of an incentive to play the game’s single-player mode.. Modern Warfare pre-load dates for PS4, PS5 and Xbox. If you’ve already pre-ordered the game, but you’re not sure when each element drops, here you’ll find all the important dates and times for the upcoming launch.. An important point to note is that there’ll be a regional rollout for PlayStation and Xbox, while PC players will have a set time that the game releases, regardless of region.. Although there’s a lot of concern around the Call Of Duty franchise possibly becoming an Xbox exclusive, for the time being it’ll still be available on PlayStation, with players receiving extra time to pre-load the game over other systems.. That means PlayStation owners will be able to pre-load the full game starting on Thursday, October 20 – the same day the campaign early access begins.. If you’re an Xbox user you’ll be able to pre-load the full game a day earlier, on Wednesday, October 19. This is all due to an existing marketing agreement between Sony and Activision, which won’t expire for another three years.. To pre-load the game on Battle.net and Steam, you’ll have to wait until Wednesday, October 26, which means you’ll get a little over a day to download the game before its release.. Here you can find all the exact dates and times that the campaign early access and the full game will launch across the UK:. If you want to be prepared, better write those times down (pic: Activision)As always, you should take this information with a grain of salt, as a lot of things can go wrong that could delay the launch.. Though hopefully, things will go much smoother for Modern Warfare 2.. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 launches for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on Friday, October 28..

Get your blazers ready (Picture: Getty/Rex/ NBC)This article contains affiliate links. We will earn a small commission on purchases made through one of these links but this never influences our experts’ opinions. Products are tested and reviewed independently of commercial initiatives.. Everywhere you look on the high street, there are chunky loafers, sweater vests, oversized boxy blazers, and chic wide-leg trousers.. Depop saw an impressive 2,771% increase in searches for ‘tartan’ over September. Meanwhile, searches for ‘knee high boots’ and ‘cable knit’ have also increased 190% and 137% month on month respectively.. On top of that, searches for ‘loafers’ went up 86%, while ‘varsity jackets’ searches also went up 62% that month – both of which have recently been seen on the likes of Hailey Bieber and Bella Hadid.. Gone are the days when money was the only signifier of cool. No longer are preppy looks relegated to the most vanilla of personalities – far from it.. Agustina Panzoni, Depop’s trends and category manager, tells Metro.co.uk: ‘It’s taken some time for cable knits and varsity jackets to shift their association with socioeconomic status, but the preppy look has developed since its origins at Ivy League and Redbrick universities and we’ve seen a new generation continue to democratise and interpret this style as their own.. Iconic fashion inspo (Picture: Paramount Pictures)‘This trend is another example of Gen Z’s fascination with references from the 90s and early 2000s, from the Clueless Chanel-inspired ensembles, Hilary Banks’ preppy looks from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air or Rory’s perfect preppy autumn wardrobe in the Gilmore Girls.. ‘The new age of preppy adopts original styles but with a modern twist. Traditional items such as loafers have a chunky new frame, while tartan patterned skirts have been hiked up by the likes of Miu Miu and Vivienne Westwood.’. Yes, the most interesting thing about this newfound preppy overtone is that it’s now applicable to loads of fashion niches – from the twee to mainstreamers to emos and goths, simply tweaking your colour choices and footwear makes being a prep cool no matter who you are.. Prep-esque looks were all over Paris Fashion Week (Picture: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images). This Fashion Week look ticks pretty much all the preppy boxes (Picture: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images). Can’t resist a good suit (Picture: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images)Maybe it has something to do with the fact that, as tweens and teens embrace baggy low-waisted jeans and crop top combos, trend-minded adults need to find an office-appropriate version that walks the line between fashion and function.. There are also so many fashion-forward preppy pop culture moments to draw from during the 90s and Y2K – eras which are still utterly dominating the trend cycle.. This Celine number is giving a good amount of indie sleeze too, thanks to that very skinny tie (Picture: Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)Agustina says: ‘Preppy fashion has long pulsed in and out of the limelight.. ‘From 90’s and 00’s classics like Clueless and Gossip Girl inspiring us to wear pleated skirts and knee-high socks, to Sex Education hailing “back to school” style, it’s safe to say preppy is officially in this autumn.’. It helps that autumn and winter happen to be the ideal time of year for a trend that relies on heavier layers to rear its head. Who wants a boxy blazer and a high collar in a heatwave?. Agustina says: ‘Preppy is perfect for the autumn to winter season, with cosy cable knits, varsity jackets and cardigans blending fashion-forward outerwear with comfort in the cold weather.’. 00s classics like Gossip Girl may have sparked the trend (Picture: James Devaney/WireImage)In a post-lockdown world, it also makes particular sense that people would want to dress a little more formally, but still keep over-sized comfort of wide-legged trousers and big boxy blazers at the forefront of their minds.. ‘The chunky Prada loafer has made its mark, and it seems everyone’s adopting a love for loafers this year,’ says Agustina. ‘Depop users are certainly in favour, as we’ve seen an 86% increase in searches for “loafers” this month alone.. ‘We love the way Hailey Beiber is styling her loafers with white socks at the moment, while Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner are known for taking classic preppy pieces and working them into their Y2K style.. ‘If you want to make a real bourgeois statement, layer in a classic necktie to emulate looks we’ve seen across Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren runways this season. Sellers such as @elvintageclothingofficial source unique, vintage ties that Blair Waldorf would envy.’. Vero Moda tailored suit blazer and skirt co-ord in chocolate.

This does, however, mean all versions of the game will cost the same price.What’s included in ‘Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’ vault edition?The premium-tier bundle for Modern Warfare 2 is priced at £99.99 and includes the following bonuses, along with the base game:Ghost Legacy pack in multiplayer and WarzoneRed Team 141 operator packFJX Cinder weapon vaultSeason one battle pass50 tier skipsWill ‘Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’ have a zombie mode?Previous iterations of Call of Duty have featured a multiplayer zombie-survival mode, which sees players tasked with surviving waves of undead enemies in an enclosed arena for as long as possible. Unfortunately, Modern Warfare 2 will not have this feature available, much like 2019’s Modern Warfare release. When will ‘Warzone 2’ be released?Warzone 2 is Call of Duty’s equivalent to a free-to-play battle-royale game – much like Fortnite and Apex Legends – and will be available to download separately at no extra cost to Modern Warfare 2.While Modern Warfare 2 is being released on 28 October 2022, Warzone 2 will be released at a later date of 16 November 2022 and will include updates to the original Warzone, such as a new map called “Al Mazrah”. Like Modern Warfare 2, Warzone 2 will be available to play on PlayStation, Xbox and PC platforms. Will COD Points transfer to ‘Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’?COD Points are a form of currency that can be unlocked in Warzone via in-game progression or microtransactions, which can be used to unlock new customisations or a battle pass to take part in the latest season.As COD Points are linked to players’ Activision accounts, it’s expected that any outstanding balances will automatically be transferred to Warzone 2 when it launches in November, as it is effectively a continuation of the service with some major updates made to it.If you are planning to switch platforms between titles, however (such as between PlayStation and Xbox), there have been reports of Activision customer support staff advising customers that points may not transfer across, according to GGRecon.If Activision clarify the situation, we’ll be sure to keep you updated.

      "Xbox Series S is holding back ‘entire generation’ and Gotham Knights | Metro News. Xbox Series S is holding back ‘entire generation’ and Gotham Knights says dev. Can you spot the difference? (pic: Metro.co.uk)A Rocksteady developer has described the Xbox Series S as a ‘potato’ that has ‘hamstrung’ modern games on next gen consoles.. To most people the Xbox Series S is the best bargain of the generation, especially when combined with Xbox Game Pass. It’s significantly cheaper than the Xbox Series X and yet runs all the same games, with the only apparent drawback being no native 4K support and a lack of a disc drive.. However, on paper it is considerably less powerful than either of the more expensive next gen consoles and one developer claims that it’s actually holding back the entire generation, since it becomes the lowest common denominator that all multiformat games must support.. The suggestion comes from Lee Devonald, the senior character technical artist at Rocksteady, makers of the original Batman: Arkham trilogy and the upcoming Suicide Squad game. He claims that an ‘entire generation of games [are] hamstrung by that potato’ and that it’s ‘not much better’ than a last gen console.. Devonald has since deleted his entire Twitter account, so his comments are very obviously not endorsed by Rocksteady or anyone else, but they do mirror concerns about exclusive games on the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 still having to run on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.. This clearly holds back their design, since the last gen consoles don’t have an SSD drive for fast loading, let alone the other technical advancements, and Devonald is saying that the Xbox Series S is almost as bad.. ‘Multi-platform games always have to optimise for the lowest performer’, said Devonald, before pointing out that ‘Microsoft won’t let you launch on one without the other.’. Devonald got onto the subject by responding to the news that Gotham Knights only runs at 30fps and does not have a performance option for 60fps, as many modern games do.. Saturnalia review - getting away from it allIt’s unclear whether Devonald has any insider knowledge of the game, as while Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montréal almost certainly has talked to Rocksteady about the game, since they’re both owned by the same company, their involvement is likely to be minimal.. ð¨â¼ï¸ð¨ðSenior dev says Xbox Series S is holding back this generation of games and says itâs not much better than a last gen console. pic.twitter.com/evrnGqt9Zc— THE RED DRAGON ðº (@TWTHEREDDRAGON) October 15, 2022.

Thank you for registeringPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged inVoicesSuella Braverman is gaslighting victims of modern slaveryA dangerous narrative is being spread – and victims of slavery up and down the country are being failedJasmine O'ConnorTuesday 18 October 2022 10:11Comments. In towns, streets and communities all across the UK, people are trapped in modern slavery. This is not only a failure, but an affront to us all. At a time when the UK needs an urgent upgrade of existing legislation and policies on modern slavery that better protect people, instead, a dangerous narrative is being spread – and victims of slavery up and down the country are being failed.For years, we have been challenging the UK government as it embeds its hostile immigration policies, normalising dangerous rhetoric that pitches communities against those in need of support and protection. This rhetoric harms victims and survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking – people who have already been denied their rights and freedom – by dragging them into a toxic debate that further dehumanises them.Somewhere along the way, our government has forgotten that behind the toxic headlines about modern slavery there are victims, real people who are simply trying to live their lives free from exploitation – people who have already endured terrible suffering and that our research with the Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group shows are being let down by the measures in place to protect them. We rarely hear the voices and stories of those most affected, and are rarely reminded that this could happen to us. Without a seat at the table, how can the survivors of modern slavery tell their stories and help to improve the system that so many rely upon?When Sir Mo Farah bravely disclosed that he was a victim of modern slavery, we had the opportunity to meet the person behind the headlines. Calls were made to ensure that Sir Mo was not pursued on immigration grounds and instead given the grace to heal from his trauma, in safety, in the UK. RecommendedSuella Braverman says she 'foresaw' concerns at Manston asylum centreOpinion: Listening to Braverman is like being sucked into a viral Facebook scamLetters: We call on this government to break the cycle of povertyWe caught a glimpse of the staggering human story, the story of how human trafficking and modern slavery affect lives. We saw that this trauma is compounded by policies and narratives that conflate modern slavery and immigration. This misrepresentation needs to be fixed, and we need to make sure that the many silenced voices are elevated to deliver a serious dose of reality and humanity to our government’s policymaking.We know from Home Office data that the number of potential victims of slavery in the UK is at an all-time high, with nearly 13,000 people referred in 2021. Experts suggest that the true number of victims of modern slavery in the UK could be more than 100,000. Data from the Home Office itself consistently tells us that more than 90 per cent of victims referred into the system receive a positive decision on their cases – confirming that they have been victims of modern slavery. Yet last week the home secretary, Suella Braverman, stated that people were trying to “game the system” and “derailing the UK’s policy on illegal immigration”. Anti-Slavery International, like other experts in our field, knows of no evidence that suggests the system is being successfully abused. In fact, today, the head of the labour abuse watchdog – the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority – even challenged the Home Office narrative, confirming there is no evidence of abuse in the system.The 2015 Modern Slavery Act sat as a centrepiece of compassionate conservatism. But these protective measures are slowly but surely being picked apart. New measures – including the Nationality and Borders Act and the Rwanda policy – are being accompanied by dangerous narratives that scapegoat victims and question their integrity, with the home secretary herself asserting last week that people are lying about being trafficked.To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking hereThe government needs to honestly listen to survivors and safeguard them against future abuse, not use them as pawns in a game of hostile rhetoric and a divide-and-rule strategy.The government has committed to a new bill on modern slavery, but this bill must extend – rather than roll back – support and protections for all victims. We urgently need to change the way we understand and act upon modern slavery. And we all have a role to play. RecommendedHelp me ban lying in politics – we need change now | Liz Saville RobertsSunak is no pragmatist – and the opposition now has a choice to make | Jeremy CorbynHow much humiliation are Tory MPs willing to endure under Sunak? | Tom PeckThe government must listen to survivors and invite them to take part in decision-making that would help make laws stronger and truly protect people. Whether at the highest levels of government or in our own communities, we need decent, compassionate people everywhere to challenge the dangerous narratives that want us to forget our humanity.Jasmine O’Connor OBE is chief executive of Anti-Slavery International. 1/1Suella Braverman is gaslighting victims of modern slavery.

Suella Braverman is drawing up new laws in a bid to cut the number of migrants crossing the Channel. Please enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our privacy noticeThe government has been accused of “scapegoating” modern slavery victims as it draws up new laws to restrict claims by asylum seekers. The Independent understands that Suella Braverman wants to stop what she sees as the abuse of current powers by migrants crossing the English Channel, after accusing them of “gaming the system”.New legislation which could change the operation of Theresa May's Modern Slavery Act is being discussed by the Home Office, Downing Street and government lawyers.The plans go further than a package of immigration laws brought in by Priti Patel that criminalised Channel crossings, aiming to make sure that the Rwanda deal and other moves to reject asylum seekers can be implemented.In an exclusive article for The Independent, the head of Anti-Slavery International accused the new home secretary of spreading “dangerous narratives that scapegoat victims and question their integrity”.RecommendedAlbania asylum guidance under review after home secretary says ‘trafficking claims are lies’Suella Braverman’s modern slavery ‘abuse’ claims questioned by former watchdogRecord number of suspected modern slavery victims in UKJasmine O’Connor OBE added: “The government needs to honestly listen to survivors, and safeguard them against future abuse, not use them as a pawn in a game of hostile rhetoric and a divide and rule strategy.“This bill must extend – rather than roll back – support and protections for all victims.”In her Conservative Party conference speech, Ms Braverman said that some Albanian migrants crossing the English Channel were claiming protection but “their claims of being trafficked are lies”.She added: “The hard truth is that our modern slavery laws are being abused by people gaming the system. We’ve seen a 450 per cent increase in modern slavery claims since 2014.”Ms Braverman said convicted paedophiles and rapists had also tried to “game the system” by using claims of modern slavery to block deportations, including a man who went on to commit a further rape.Until recently, most modern slavery victims recognised by the UK's official system were British children exploited by criminal gangs but the new government has handed modern slavery to the minister responsible for illegal immigration and asylum. The move is believed to be sparked by a rising number of cases involving Albanian adults using the National Referral Mechanism, the system used by the government to identify modern slavery victims. Albanians overtook British children as the largest single group earlier this year and have also become a dominant nationality in small boat crossings.Between April and June, 91 per cent of adults and 92 per cent of children assessed by the National Referral Mechanism received “conclusive grounds decisions”, meaning they are granted specialist support as victims of slavery, trafficking, criminal exploitation or forced labour.✕Suella Braverman says seeing a plane taking off to Rwanda is 'her dream'The UN special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, Tomoya Obokata, said: “Designating modern slavery as an illegal migration issue is misleading as British nationals are also victimised. “This also stigmatises foreign victims who have suffered gross violations of human rights. Protection of all victims must be a priority.”The watchdog charged with overseeing modern slavery laws in the UK has not had a commissioner in place since April, and the former incumbent said she did not recognise Ms Braverman’s abuse claims.Dame Sara Thornton, the former independent anti-slavery commissioner, said that the number of referrals had risen since 2014 because of work by the Home Office, police and authorities to spot victims.“This is a hidden crime and we have got a lot better at identifying victims,” she told The Independent. “There has been a lot of work done by police forces, local authorities, Border Force and Immigration Enforcement to know what the signs are.“I don’t know where the evidence for claiming the rise is because of abuse has come from.”The government’s public appointments website says the competition for a new independent anti-slavery commissioner has closed, but there has been no announcement since final interviews took place six months ago.A post on the watchdog’s website said it has “no remit to provide views or take on or contribute to new work” in the absence of a commissioner – meaning it cannot assess Ms Braverman’s plans.RecommendedMichael Gove confronted with Suella Braverman's 'delete and ignore' emailBraverman reveals fresh details about ministerial code breachRishi Sunak has ‘full confidence’ in beleaguered home secretary Suella BravermanA Home Office spokesperson said: “We are committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and in the UK we have a world-leading response. However, it is clear people are abusing our system when they have no right to be here, in order to frustrate their removal.“We must be able to tackle abuses in the system and make sure foreign national offenders or those who arrive here illegally and have no right to stay in the UK are not able to misuse a system intended to protect genuine victims in order to avoid justice.”.

Return of the pressure cooker: Sales of energy-saving gadgets that our grandparents used are on the rise, retailers reportPressure cookers and heated blankets have made a comeback as bills soarJohn Lewis says purchases of pressure cookers are now up by 110 per cent They use a combination of heat, steam, high pressure to tenderise cuts of meatSales of slow cookers up as well as modern air fryers - up by some 176 per centBy Sean Poulter Consumer Affairs Editor For The Daily Mail. They've been out of fashion for decades, but as bills soar, pressure cookers and heated blankets have made a comeback.Retailers report that sales of the sort of energy-saving gadgets our grandparents used are on the rise.John Lewis says purchases of pressure cookers are up by 110 per cent and slow cookers by 262 per cent. Sales of modern air fryers are also up by 176 per cent.A fixture in the homes of earlier generations, pressure cookers use a combination of heat, steam and high pressure to tenderise cheap cuts of meat and cook meals faster than an oven or hob.But anxiety about whether they were safe to use – and the advent of the microwave – made them fall out of favour. Simply opening up a scalding metal pan filled with high-pressure steam was something of a lottery – with many fearing the lid would explode across the kitchen.. John Lewis says purchases of pressure cookers are up by 110 per cent and slow cookers by 262 per cent. Pictured: Tefal Jamie Oliver Clipso pressure cooker at John Lewis. Pictured: A pressure cooker ad from the 1950s. The energy-saving gadgets that our grandparents used are on the riseHowever, modern ones are far easier and safer to use and many have automated settings. The manufacturer Crockpot estimates that an electrical pressure cooker generally uses around 500W to cook an average stew in just 21 minutes, compared with 205 minutes to cook the same meal using around 3,000W in a conventional oven. Sales of electric blankets, thermal underwear, hot water bottles and insulated flasks are also soaring.Research by the insurance firm Aviva predicts a 113 per cent increase by the end of the year in adults who own a 'sleeved blanket' that can be worn like a robe, while owners of electric blankets could be up by 89 per cent.Ownership of vacuum flasks is predicted to increase by 44 per cent as an alternative to splashing out in coffee shops.There is also expected to be a 33 per cent spike in sales of hot water bottles – and a suggestion that people could even be saving money by making their own clothes, with those owning sewing machines forecast to rise by 60 per cent.Explaining the popularity of pressure cookers for hard-pressed modern homeowners, a John Lewis spokesman said: 'The cooking method often used by our parents and grandparents to tenderise cheaper cuts of meat is once again popular as thrifty, time-poor cooks rediscover the time and fuel-saving benefits of these marvellous machines.'.

      "Kwasi Kwarteng: what has been the ex-chancellor career to date? | Evening Standard. NewsPoliticsKwasi Kwarteng: what has been the ex-chancellor’s career to date?The shortest-serving chancellor since 1970 has been an MP for 12 years. Kwasi Kwarteng had earlier worked at the Treasury before his brief stint as chancellor. Seren Morris14 October 2022Kwasi Kwarteng has resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer because of the backlash to his mini-budget. He was recalled from an IMF meeting in Washington DC and met the prime minister, Liz Truss, on Friday October 14, who asked for his resignation.He had earlier hit a record low approval rating because of the mayhem caused by his mini-budget, according to a poll, which revealed 65 per cent of people in the UK were dissatisfied with him. His U-turn in ditching his plan to axe the 45p top rate of income tax was not enough to save him and, after he went, Truss announced she was reversing a plan to scrap an increase in corporation tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent planned by the previous government. The rise will therefore go ahead. The new Chancellor of the Exchequer is Jeremy Hunt. So who is Kwarteng, and how did he come to be chancellor?How did Kwarteng get the job of chancellor?Read MoreTruss’s investment zones under review as Gove draws environmental red linesCalls for investigation after report claims Liz Truss’s phone ‘was hacked’Sunak promises ‘fairness’ as he looks to fund up to £50bn in cuts and tax risesSPONSOREDInside the mind of a British ultrarunning legendTruss made Kwarteng the chancellor when she was elected leader of the Conservative Party. He was in the role from September 6 to October 14, just 38 days, the shortest period since Iain Mcleod in 1970 who survived only 30 days in post.Kwarteng was previously Secretary of State at the Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy, and before that, was the parliamentary under secretary of state in the Department for Exiting the European Union.Kwasi Kwarteng had the shortest tenure as chancellor in modern times. / Kirsty O’Connor/PA WireAdditionally, Kwarteng has worked as parliamentary private secretary to the leader of the House of Lords, and parliamentary private secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Chancellor was elected the Conservative MP for Spelthorne in 2010, and previously held positions on the transport select committee, the work and pensions select committee, and the public accounts committee.Before becoming an MP, Kwarteng worked as an analyst in financial services, after studying at Cambridge University and Harvard University, earning a PhD in economic history at the former.What does the Chancellor of the Exchequer do?The Chancellor of the Exchequer is the Government’s chief financial minister.The chancellor is responsible for raising revenue through taxes or borrowing, as well as controlling public spending.The chancellor’s responsibilities include presenting the annual Budget, setting inflation targets, ministerial arrangements, and overall responsibility for the Treasury’s response to Covid-19.Rishi Sunak was a longstanding chancellor by current standards, holding the office for 873 days. / PA WireBefore Kwarteng took on the role, Nadhim Zahawi was Chancellor of the Exchequer between July 5, 2022 and September 6, 2022, 63 days.Rishi Sunak held the title from 2020 until 2022, taking over from Sajid Javid, who was chancellor from 2019 to 2020.Philip Hammond, George Osborne, Alistair Darling, and Gordon Brown have all also been chancellors.Register for free to continue readingSign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events.ALREADY HAVE AN ACCOUNT?

Liz Truss less popular than ANY modern PM has been after a month in power as approval rating hits -51 making her less popular than Boris Johnson, Theresa May and David Cameron EVER wereBy David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline. Liz Truss is less popular with the public than any of her immediate Tory predecessors ever were, new figures reveal today. The Prime Minister has an approval rating of -51, the lowest of any modern premier at this stage of their term in office.Two thirds (67 per cent) of Brits told Ipsos they were dissatisfied with her performance, up 38 points in a month. And just 16 per cent were satisfied, a fall of 11 points as the public discover more about her. Her net score is worse than the lowest scores ever achieved by Boris Johnson (-46), Theresa May (-44), David Cameron (-38) and Tony Blair (-44). It equals Gordon Brown's unpopularity in July 2008 during the financial crisis (-51), whilst John Major (-59) and Margaret Thatcher (-56) both slipped lower during their own economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s. However, no PM has reached this low so quickly in their tenure.Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos, said: 'While at first the public was reserving judgement, the danger for both of them is that in only their second month those early impressions have rapidly become much more negative.'Even in our long-term trends going back over the decades there are few Prime Ministers (and no chancellors) with worse scores, and none that have deteriorated so quickly.. 'Underpinning this is the poor reaction to their economic policies, which many think will leave them worse off during high levels of concern about the cost of living, and for which the Government is being held increasingly responsible – and from which Labour is benefiting. Ms Truss executed another humiliating U-turn on her flagship tax cuts today after 24 hours of extraordinary drama that saw her sack Kwasi Kwarteng and bring back Jeremy Hunt to quell market chaos.Barely a month into her premiership, Ms Truss fronted a make-or-break press conference to abandon plans to keep corporation tax at 19p, rather than hiking it to 25p in April.She said she had made a 'difficult' decision for 'economic security' and 'in the national interest', but argued that her 'mission' to reduce taxes remained. 'We will get through this storm,' she said. 'The mission remains the same.. but ultimately we have to make sure we have economic stability.'Under fierce fire from journalists, Ms Truss refused to apologise for 'trashing' the Tories' reputation - before abruptly walking out after eight minutes and just four question..

      "The chancellor earlier said his “total focus is on delivering on the mini-budget” in response to speculation about a U-turn on the measures. Kwarteng said he is “not going anywhere”. Liz Truss is on the cusp of putting up corporation tax as part of a Downing Street plan to back down from the huge package of unfunded tax cuts in her mini-budget, sources claim.. Senior Conservatives are holding talks about replacing Liz Truss with a joint ticket of Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt as part of a “coronation” by MPs, according to The Times. Party grandees are understood to be in talks about replacing Truss with a “unity candidate”. Former home secretary Priti Patel has become the latest high-profile Tory MP to suggest the government could be forced into a further U-turn over the mini-budget. Patel was asked if Liz Truss’s commitment not to raise corporation tax should be reversed to calm the markets. “There is an irony to this,” Patel told Sky News. “In that market forces will probably dictate some of these changes now. “The market is going to dictate this, primarily because we want to see stability.”. Labour MP Christina Rees has been stripped of the party whip after allegations of bullying her constituency staff, the Guardian can reveal. Rees, who was shadow Wales secretary during Jeremy Corbyn’s time as leader, will now sit as an independent in the House of Commons. It is understood that there will be an internal Labour party investigation into the allegations and Rees, the MP for Neath, will have her party membership suspended until the case is resolved.. 13 Oct 202222.40 BSTLabour has pledged to ban fracking “once and for all” as it hit out at suggestions that the government could move to ban solar farms from much of England’s farmland.The party intends to work with MPs who oppose fracking to force the government to maintain the ban, one of several issues to divide the Conservatives since Liz Truss became leader.The new administration’s environmental commitments have come under severe scrutiny in recent weeks after lifting England’s fracking ban, in place since 2019 following a series of earth tremors, and giving the green light to the expansion of oil and gas operations in the North Sea.Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow climate secretary, will visit Bassetlaw on Friday to meet with the party’s candidate Jo White and local residents to listen to concerns about the potential for fracking in their area.Labour is working to bring forward an opposition day motion to maintain the current ban, Miliband is expected to tell locals during his visit.He said: “Labour will stand with communities in opposing the Conservatives’ dodgy plans to impose expensive, dirty, and dangerous fracking on the British people.“Fracking would make no difference to energy prices, and could risk the health of local communities, nature, and water supplies.”13 Oct 202222.30 BSTA senior Tory MP believes it is “premature” for the party to think about getting rid of Liz Truss, amid reports that some Conservatives are holding talks about replacing the prime minister with a joint ticket of former leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt.The MP told the PA news agency that it would be seen as “completely bonkers to have three prime ministers in one year”.13 Oct 202222.16 BSTAnna Soubry, a former Conservative MP, has said it is time for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to be prime minister. In response to a tweet asking “is it time for Rishi”, Soubry, a criminal lawyer, said: “It’s time for #KeirStarmer - he’d be a prime minister we could trust to deliver what we desperately need - stability, competence and honesty.”It’s time for #KeirStarmer - he’d be a Prime Minister we could trust to deliver what we desperately need - stability, competence and honesty. https://t.co/jIKKtymL4J— Anna Soubry (@Anna_Soubry) October 13, 2022. 13 Oct 202221.57 BSTSenior Conservatives are holding talks about replacing Liz Truss with a joint ticket of Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt as part of a “coronation” by MPs, according to The Times.Party grandees are understood to be in talks about replacing Truss with a “unity candidate”.An MP told the newspaper: “Rishi’s people, Penny’s people and the sensible Truss supporters who realise she’s a disaster just need to sit down together and work out who the unity candidate is. “It’s either Rishi as prime minister with Penny as his deputy and foreign secretary, or Penny as prime minister with Rishi as chancellor. “They would promise to lead a government of all the talents and most MPs would fall in behind that.”13 Oct 202221.47 BSTHere is a selection of some of Friday’s front pages.FT UK: ⁦@trussliz⁩ ready to rip up tax-cut package in desperate bid to save Premiership #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/aiusxbQq4F— Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) October 13, 2022. 13 Oct 202221.18 BSTIn the latest round of extraordinary polling, a survey by People Polling for the Daily Telegraph has found Labour’s lead has stretched to a huge 34 points, with Labour on 53% and the Conservatives at just 19%.In worse news for Liz Truss, just 9% of the public have a favourable view of her.Prof Matthew Goodwin, the pollster behind the research, told the newspaper [£]: “These numbers mean that Liz Truss is more unpopular than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn ever were – she is basically in what I would call Prince Andrew territory.”Updated at 21.30 BST13 Oct 202221.04 BSTLiz Truss has bowed to intense pressure from Conservative MPs and the markets by agreeing to redraw her mini-budget, paving the way for a major U-turn on her signature corporation tax cut.In another serious blow to her authority as prime minister, government sources told the Guardian that a climbdown on the plan to scrap the rise in corporation tax was now “on the table”.After weeks of defending the proposal, Downing Street officials and ministers are now trying to balance the books after announcing a huge package of unfunded tax cuts.Read our full story of the day’s events hereLiz Truss bows to pressure with corporation tax U-turn ‘on the table’Read more13 Oct 202220.35 BSTThe former minister Johnny Mercer has hit out at the government as he shared how his constituents have been impacted by rising interest rates after the mini-budget.He described the impact on mortgage holders and people seeking to buy a home as “politically unsurvivable”.He tweeted: “Dozens of these across Plymouth. I want you to know that I get it, that most of us get it, and that we will do all we can to change it.“Heartbreaking. Unconscionable. Politically unsurvivable. I got into politics to help people like this. Will not stand and watch it burn.”13 Oct 202219.58 BSTAlicia Kearns, the new chairwoman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested the government’s tax cuts should be scrapped to calm the markets.She was asked on LBC’s Tonight With Andrew Marr whether she would like to see the tax cuts reversed.“Do I think we should be borrowing en masse where our children have to pay this back for decades to come? No, I don’t,” she said.Pressed by Marr, she stressed that sometimes governments need to take “extraordinary steps”.“But clearly, in the approach and the manner in which this has been done, that is the issue. Because the markets are not woke, the markets are not left. “The fact they are not lefty, anti-government, the fact they have been spooked, is something that should be taken incredibly seriously. And often it is about the manner, and the fact is we govern only with the support of the people, and we are not bringing them with us currently.“We all want Liz Truss to succeed in that the country needs her to succeed. And it is about recognising that actually, sometimes baby steps can result in more meaningful and embraced change than perhaps a bonfire.”13 Oct 202219.47 BSTGiles Wilkes, a former special advisor to Theresa May, believes Liz Truss is facing “possibly the most difficult situation a prime minister has been in this side of the Second World War”. Wilkes, a senior fellow at the Institute of Government, told Sky News: “I can’t think of somebody who’s put themselves into such a position where they’re forced to defend something that nobody else thinks is defensible, and forced to contemplate really tough measures like slashing benefits or slashing important government spending budgets in order to try to keep a policy that nobody else believes can go on the road. “It’s an incredibly difficult position, but right now, she’s playing for survival stakes. She has to think, ‘what do I need to throw overboard in order to keep things going?’ And if it’s pretty much all the policies announced in the so-called mini budget, then that’s the only thing I can think she can do.”Wilkes said it is difficult to see how the Conservative party could justify a change of leadership without a general election and a U-turn on the mini-budget “might be the only way the government can actually get out of this self-made disaster”.13 Oct 202219.36 BSTThe prime minister has been warned not to row back on key social care reforms as this would be to “abandon some of the most vulnerable people in our society”.Sir Andrew Dilnot said pulling back on promised reforms would be “deeply regrettable”, and that he hopes Liz Truss is the PM who “finally” sees through substantial change for the sector.Sir Andrew, who led a review into the future of funding social care under the coalition government and was the architect of the original plans for a care cap, said it is “absolutely essential” the current government’s planned reforms while “less generous” than those he set out, go ahead as scheduled.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Reforming social care is a priority. That’s why we’re backing the sector with £5.4 billion over the next three years to support our planned reforms, bolster the workforce and protect people from unpredictable care costs.“We are working with local authorities, our charging reform trailblazers, care providers and other stakeholders - including the Local Government Association - to implement the changes and make sure everyone can access the care they need, when they need it.”NewestNewestPrevious1 of 7NextOldestOldestTopicsPoliticsPolitics live with Andrew SparrowLiz TrussConservativesJames CleverlyLabourReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKWorldClimate crisisNewslettersFootballCoronavirusBusinessEnvironmentUK politicsEducationSocietyScienceTechGlobal developmentObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersModern Slavery ActDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsPatronsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      "Call Of Duty 2023 is just a DLC expansion for Modern Warfare 2 | Metro News. Call Of Duty 2023 is just a DLC expansion for Modern Warfare 2 claim sources. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – it sounds like an expansion is also on the way (pic: Activision)Rumours continue to insist there’ll be no Call Of Duty sequel next year, but allegedly there will be a major paid-for expansion instead.. For a long time now, the rumour has been that there will be no new Call Of Duty in 2023, not because of the Microsoft acquisition but as continued fallout from the failure of Vanguard and Activision’s recognition that the series needs time to reset itself.. As sensible as that sounds Activision has denied those plans, although its last comment on the issue was ambiguous enough that it’s hard to tell what they meant. According to the latest rumours though there’s definitely no new game, just new paid-for DLC.. The plan has already been corroborated by two trusted sources and suggests that the DLC will be released in 2023 in a bundle with a ‘greatest hits map pack’ to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Call Of Duty, something that has already been rumoured separately.. There’s no indication of what exactly the expansion will be, but the map pack will apparently include remastered classic maps from the original Modern Warfare 2, from 2009, and other older titles.. The rumours were originally spread by Call Of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope but then backed up by Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, who was one of those that originally made the suggestion that there’d be no mainline entry in 2023.. Next year they'll be selling new stuff for MW2, an expansion or something like that (not sure exactly what it'll look like but it'll have campaign stuff too). No actual new COD until 2024 as I reported earlier this year. He didn’t mention the supposed map pack but suggested that Activision would be selling ‘an expansion or something like that’ next year.. Schreier didn’t claim to know what form the expansion would take but said that it would include ‘campaign stuff too’. So the best guess at the moment is some sort of new story campaign and the map pack to cover the multiplayer side of the game.. PS5 console sales reach 25 million but PS Plus subscriptions fall by 2 million. Saturnalia review - getting away from it allIt’s unclear when Activision would make any kind of official announcement of their plans, but it probably won’t be this year.. For now, they’re more concerned with the launch of the new Modern Warfare 2, which will arrive for last and current gen consoles and PC on October 28.. Call Of Duty: Warzone 2.0, whose launch is believed to be another reason Activision is skipping next year, arrives on November 16..

      "Blackadder writer Ben Elton compares woke culture with Mao's Communist China | Daily Mail Online. Blackadder writer Ben Elton compares modern wokery with Chairman Mao's communist China and says younger generation is 'all about making rules'Ben Elton, 63, has compared the modern woke movement to communist ChinaThe comedian said there are 'rules' and 'things you can no longer say' Comedian Jennifer Saunders previously said the woke mindset changed comedyBy Danya Bazaraa For Mailonline. Comedian Ben Elton has compared the modern woke movement to communist China, claiming 'there are things you can no longer say'. Elton, 63, who found fame as a screenwriter on Eighties sitcoms Blackadder and The Young Ones, contrasted comedy in the past and now – saying his generation was all about 'breaking rules' while the younger generation today is all about 'making rules'. Speaking to Radio Times, Elton said: 'There is a whiff of Maoism in the air, the whiff of cultural revolution.. Comedian Ben Elton has compared the way of thinking today to Maoism, a form of communism developed by Mao Tse Tung, also known as Chairman Mao'There is now a new way of thinking – and you will be required to think it.'My wife came up with a good observation the other day. She said our generation was all about breaking rules and it seems like the younger generation is all about making rules.'These are things you can no longer say, these are things you should now be saying.' Maoism was developed by Mao Tse Tung, also known as Chairman Mao, who was the founder of the People's Republic of China which he led as the head of the Chinese Communist Party from 1949 until his death in 1976.Elton said a feature of acts in the 1980s was a movement against racist and sexist comedy, adding that they had a new mindset and tried to find new ways to be funny. The comedian said he is proud the language of The Young Ones and Blackadder is 'still part of the culture'.. Elton is known for his work behind the scenes as a screenwriter on popular sitcom BlackadderHe appeared in front of the camera as the host of Channel 4 stand-up comedy programme Friday Night Live, which launched in 1985 and was responsible for helping to boost the popularity of a number of now-household names including Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. Elton's comments about today's culture come after Absolutely Fabulous's Jennifer Saunders made similar remarks last year. The television star and comedian, 64, said that the new 'woke' mind-set has changed comedy and people now 'talk themselves out' of telling any jokes that might be considered controversial.'Yes I think it has changed comedy like what we used to make. I think we would probably talk ourselves out of most of it now,' she said during a talk at the Garrick Theatre. 'It would be like, 'We won't have a good answer so let's not do that.\"'I think people do talk themselves out of stuff now because everything is sensitive in a funny way and what could be made to seem sensitive and it stops a lot of the fun maybe like jokes. I remember jokes. Silly jokes and stuff.'. Elton is set to reprise his hosting duties later this month when Friday Night Live returns to screens with a one-off special as part of Channel 4's 40th anniversary celebrations.Speaking about the return of the show, which was initially called Saturday Live before moving to its Friday night slot, Elton expressed his delight at the fact that the show will once again be completely live.He said: 'Those who know the show, from years ago, I hope they'll know what to expect: Great all live entertainment, proper cabaret, the way it used to be.'I mean, I think that's what's missing from telly now. Everyone's watching things on their phones, pre-recorded, streamers, you know binging something over a week, and nothing's immediate... But Saturday Live and Friday Night Live are kind of dangerous telly. 'There's no delay, everyone's doing their act, absolutely there is no edit, there's no cuts, there's no pause.'The audience either laugh or they don't and you either get it right or you don't.'The special will feature a selection of familiar faces who found fame on the show as well as new comedy talent currently on the circuit, including Harry Enfield, Jo Brand, Julian Clary, Rosie Jones and Mawaan Rizwan.The programme will be shown on Channel 4 and All 4 on October 21 at 9pm as part of Channel 4's Truth and Dare season, which is celebrating 40 years of the broadcaster..

Unexpected Call Of Duty crossover as Messi and Neymar rumoured to appear as playable characters in Modern Warfare 2. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 – Just when you thought things couldn’t get weirder after the Snoop Dogg skin (pic: Activision)It’s claimed that a list of real-world footballers can be found in Modern Warfare 2’s files, suggesting they’ll be playable operators.. The Call Of Duty series is no stranger to crossovers, with Call Of Duty: Warzone adding characters from The Terminator, Rambo, and Die Hard.. However, there have been a couple of weird ones. Between the likes of Warzone’s Godzilla Vs Kong event and the Snoop Dogg skin for Call Of Duty: Vanguard, it feels like Activision wants Call Of Duty to become its own Fortnite equivalent.. If the latest rumour is to be believed, fans could see its most bizarre crossover yet with real-world footballers being added to Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.. It’s claimed that a list of footballers can be found in the in-game files for Modern Warfare 2. The game itself has yet to launch, but these could have been acquired via the beta sessions that ran last month.. The list doesn’t contain any full names so, at a first glance, them being for footballers seems like a stretch.. However, the list includes the likes of Messi and Neymar, two prominent footballers from the Paris Sant-Germain club. There is also Paul Pogba, who plays for Juventus Football Club and the France national team.. Unless Activision has coincidentally created original characters that share a name with them, the immediate assumption is that it is indeed planning to add them and other footballers as playable operators.. Regular Call Of Duty leaker TheGhostOfHope was the first to claim this, with Tom Henderson of Insider Gaming, a reliable insider when it comes to Call Of Duty leaks, corroborating.. Whoever Gromsco is, they don’t seem to exist. Googling their name only brings up coverage of this rumoured list..

Assuming this is accurate, perhaps it’s pointing to a future crossover event for Call Of Duty: Warzone 2.0 involving this year’s FIFA World Cup.. It begins on November 20, which is is roughly one month after Modern Warfare 2 launches so Activision could share official info on such a crossover closer to the time.. Ikea threatens legal action over indie horror game not set in IkeaIn related news, it looks like players will need to provide a phone number if they wish to play Modern Warfare 2, according to an updated article on Blizzard Entertainment’s website..
