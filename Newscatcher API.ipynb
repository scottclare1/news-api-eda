    "# SUMMARY\n",
    "## Source: Newscatcher API\n",
    "### Good:\n",
    "* Good amount of data returned from queries\n",
    "* Good options for filtering and customising queries\n",
    "* Can search for keywords in titles, summaries and articles, allowing for filtering to human trafficking articles\n",
    "* Gives link to jpeg image associated with article - would be good for displaying alongside article in dashboard\n",
    "* Provides a rank for each news source, and score for how relevant to your query it is. Will be useful for filtering incoming data.\n",
    "* Can exclude \"opinion\" articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bad:\n",
    "* Most expensive membership fee\n",
    "* Can only query for 2 weeks in the past with free membership. 3 years with £440 p/m membership.\n",
    "* Doesn't give full article, just title and summary. Will require webscraping to get full article.\n",
    "* \"Country\" field returned isn't accurate to the location the article is written about (e.g. bbc-news/us-and-canada articles classified as country=GB). It is the country of the publisher."

      "SUELLA BRAVERMAN'S UGLY BRAND OF ‘PATRIOTISM', which seems to consist largely of being as harsh as possible towards asylum seekers, may paradoxically result in a failure to protect or support some of the most vulnerable British citizens – including children. Indeed, her approach could be a grim example of how xenophobic right-wing politics always fails the least privileged, no matter what their nationality.\n",
      "In August, a joint report from the British Red Cross and the UN Refugee Agency found that people seeking asylum in the UK were placed at risk of modern slavery because there was 'too much focus on immigration enforcement rather than safety and protection'.\n",

In the show, a hidden camera would record people's reactions to often outrageous, but innocent behaviors or situations, and then play them back to the television audience to laugh at with their friends and family.Unfortunately, more than 50 years later, ‘candid cameras' are no longer used to induce laughter. Instead, they're used to cruelly exploit and traumatize innocent individuals who have no idea that their privacy is being violated by those who post sexually provocative images of them – without their consent – for the world to see on the Internet.\n",
